And you have champions in other fields, but you see it more readily in sports. You see it over a weekend or you see it during a game. And you see that certain people stand out and they keep standing out. But it\'92s there for you, it doesn\'92t take a lifetime to find out that somebody was a winner or a loser. And so the sports thing is very interesting. But I play golf with different people and there\'92s a different mindset among champions. There\'92s really a very different mindset.

\f1\b0 \cb3 \'a0Talent wise, sometimes you can\'92t tell the difference in talent. But at the end of a weekend, they seem to win and it\'92s very interesting. As an example, Tiger or Jack Nicklaus, he was a phenomenal winner and he does have a different way about him and Tiger has a different way about him and Michael Jordan. There\'92s never one, you would think that there\'92d be one way. Arnold Palmer was the nicest guy you\'92d ever meet. And then you have some champions that aren\'92t really nice, they\'92re just focused on doing their job. So there\'92s not one type of person. But the one thing I would say that everybody seems to have in common is they\'92re very driven. They\'92re driven beyond.\

No, no, a lot of people were killed. And there are people in those buildings and they have no chance. Once they start coming down, there\'92s no chance.

\f1\b0 \cb3 \'a0Thanks for listening to this conversation with Donald Trump. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, as I\'92ve started doing here at the end of some episodes, let me make a few comments and answer a few questions. If you would like to submit questions, including in audio and video form, go to lexfridman.com/ama or get in touch with me for whatever other reason at lexfridman.com/contact. I usually do this on a T-shirt, but I figured for this episode, I\'92ll keep my suit and tie on, so first, this might be a good moment to look back a bit. I\'92ve been doing this podcast for over six years, and I first and foremost have to say thank you. I\'92m truly grateful for the support and the love I\'92ve gotten along the way. It\'92s been, I would say, the most unlikely journey.\

\f1\b0 \cb3 \'a0And on most days, I barely feel like I know what I\'92m doing. But I wanted to talk a bit about how I approach these conversations. Now, each conversation is its own unique puzzle, so I can\'92t speak generally to how I approach these, but here it may be useful to describe how I approach conversations with world leaders, of which I hope to have many more and do a better job every time. I read a lot of history and I admire the historian perspective. As an example, I admire William Shirer, the author of many books on Hitler, including The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. He was there and lived through it and covered it objectively to the degree that one could. Academic historians, by the way, criticize him for being a poor historian because he editorialized a little too much. I think those same folks criticized Dan Carlin and his Hardcore History podcast.\

\f1\b0 \cb3 \'a0I respect their criticism, but I fundamentally disagree, so in these conversations with world leaders, I try to put on my historian hat. I think in the realm of truth and public discourse, there\'92s a spectrum between the ephemeral and the eternal. The outraged mob and clickbait journalists are often focused on the ephemeral, the current thing, the current viral shitstormer of mockery and derision. But when the battle of the day is done, most of it will be forgotten. A few true ideas will remain, and those the historian hopes to capture. Now, this is much easier said than done. It\'92s not just about having the right ideals and the integrity to stick by them. It\'92s not even just about having the actual skill of talking, which I still think I suck at, but let\'92s say it\'92s a work in progress. You also have to make the scheduling work and set up the entirety of the environment in a way that is conducive to such a conversation.\

\f1\b0 \cb3 \'a0This is hard, really hard with political and business leaders. They are usually super busy and in some cases super nervous because, well, they\'92ve been screwed over so many times with clickbait got you journalism, so to convince them and their team to talk for two, three, four, five hours is hard. And I do think a good conversation requires that kind of duration. And I\'92ve been thinking a lot about why. I don\'92t think it\'92s just about needing the actual time of three hours to cover all the content. I think the longer form with a hypothetical skilled conversationalist, relaxes things and allows people to go on tangents and to banter about the details because I-\

Anyway, I look forward to talking to more world leaders and doing a better job every time as I said. I would love to do interviews with Kamala Harris and some other political figures on the left and right, including Tim Walz, AOC, Bernie, Barack Obama, Bill and Hillary. And on the right, J.D. Vance, Vivek, George W. and so on. And on the topic of politics, let me say, as an immigrant, I love this country, the United States of America. I do believe it is the greatest nation on earth, and I\'92m grateful for the people on the left and the right who step into the arena of politics to fight for this country that I do believe they all love as well.\

\f1\b0 \cb3 \'a0I have reached out to Kamala Harris, but not many of the others. I probably should do a better job with that, but I\'92ve been doing most of this myself, all the reach out, scheduling, research prep, recording and so on. And on top of that, I very much have been suffering from imposter syndrome with a voice in my head constantly pointing out when I\'92m doing a shitty job. Plus a few folks graciously remind me on the internet, the very same sentiment of this aforementioned voice. All of this, while I have the option of just hiding away at MIT, programming robots and doing some cool AI research with a few grad students, or maybe joining an AI company or maybe starting my own, all these options make me truly happy. But like I said, on most days I barely know what I\'92m doing, so who knows what the future holds. Most importantly, I\'92m forever grateful for all of you for your patience and your support throughout this rollercoaster of the life I\'92ve been on. I love you all.\

\f1\b0 \cb3 \'a0Okay, now let me go on to some of the questions that people had. I was asked by a few people to comment on Pavel Durov\'92s arrest and on X being banned in Brazil. Let me first briefly comment on the Durov arrest. Basic facts, Pavel Durov is CEO of Telegram, which is a messenger app that has end-to-end encryption mode. It\'92s not on by default, and most people don\'92t use the end-to-end encryption, but some do. Pavel was arrested in France on a long list of charges related to \'93criminal activity\'94 carried out on the Telegram platform, and for \'93providing unlicensed cryptology services.\'94 I think Telegram is indeed used for criminal activity by a small minority of its users, for example, by terrorist groups to communicate. And I think we all agree that terrorism is bad.\

\f1\b0 \cb3 \'a0But here\'92s the problem. As the old saying goes, one man\'92s terrorist is another man\'92s freedom fighter. And there are many cases in which the world unilaterally agrees who the terrorists are, but there are other cases when governments, especially authoritarian inclined governments, tend to propagandize and just call whoever\'92s in the opposition, whoever opposes them, terrorists. There is some room for nuance here, but, to me at this time, it seems to obviously be a power grab by government wanting to have backdoor access into every platform so they can have censorship power against the opposition. I think generally governments should stay out of censoring or even pressuring social media platforms, and I think arresting a CEO of a tech company for the things said on the platform he built is just nuts. It has a chilling effect on him, on people working at Telegram and on people working at every social media company, and also people thinking of launching a new social media company.\

\f1\b0 \cb3 \'a0Same as the case of X being banned in Brazil. It\'92s, I think, a power grab by Alexandre de Moraes, a Supreme Court justice in Brazil. He ordered X to block certain accounts that are spreading \'93misinformation.\'94 Elon and X denied the request, then de Moraes threatened to arrest X representatives in Brazil, and in response to that X pulled the representatives out of Brazil obviously to protect them. And now X, having no representatives in Brazil, apparently violates the law. Based on this de Moraes banned X in Brazil. Once again, it\'92s an authoritarian figure seeking censorship power over the channels of communication.\

\f1\b0 \cb3 \'a0I understand that this is complicated because there are evil people in the world and part of the role of government is to protect us from those evil people. But as Benjamin Franklin said, \'93Those who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\'94 It\'92s a trade-off, but I think in many places in the world, many governments have leaned too far away at this time from liberty.\

\f1\b0 \cb3 \'a0Okay, next up I got a question on AI, which I emotionally connected with. I\'92ll condense it as follows. \'93Hello, Lex. I\'92m a programmer and I have a deep fear of slipping into irrelevance because I am worried that AI will soon exceed my programming skills.\'94\

\f1\b0 \cb3 \'a0Let me first say that I relate to your fear. It\'92s scary to have a thing that gives you a career and gives you meaning to be taken away. For me, programming is a passion, and if not for this podcast, it would probably at least in part be my profession so I get an uncomfortable feeling every time, Claude, the LLM I use for coding at this time just writes a lot of excellent approximately correct code. I think you can make a good case that it already exceeds the skill of many programmers, at least in the same way that the collective intelligence of stack overflow exceeds the skill of many individual programmers, but in many ways it still does not. But I think eventually more and more the task, the professional programming will be one of writing natural language prompts. I think the right thing to do, and what I\'92m at least doing is to ride the wave of the ever improving code generating LLMs and keep transforming myself into a big picture designer versus low-level tinkerer. What I\'92m doing and what I recommend you do is continually switch to whatever state-of-the-art tool is for generating code. For me, currently I recently switched from VS Code to Cursor, and before that it was Emacs to VS Code switch. Cursor is this editor that\'92s based on VS Code that leans heavily on LLMs and integrates the co-generation really nicely into the editing process. It makes it super easy to continually use the LLMs. What I would advise and what I\'92m trying to do myself is to learn how to use it and to master its co-generation capabilities. I, personally, try to now allocate a significant amount of time to designing with natural language first versus writing code from scratch, so using my understanding of programming to edit the code that\'92s generated by the LLM versus writing it from scratch and then using the LLM to generate small parts of the code. I see it as a skill that I should develop in parallel to my programming skill.\

\f1\b0 \cb3 \'a0All right, next up, I got a very nice audio message and question from a gentleman who is 27 and feeling a lot of anxiety about the future. Just recently he graduated with a bachelor\'92s degree and he\'92s thinking about going to grad school for biomedical engineering, but there is a lot of anxiety. He mentioned anxiety many times in the message. It took him an extra while to get his degree, so he mentioned he would be 32 by the time he\'92s done with his PhD, so it\'92s a big investment. But he said in his heart he feels like he\'92s a scientist. I think that\'92s the most important part of his message, of your message. By the way, I\'92ll figure out how to best include audio and video messages in future episodes.\

\f1\b0 \cb3 \'a0Now onto the question. Thank you for telling me your story and for submitting the question. My own life story is similar to yours. I went to Drexel University for my bachelor\'92s, master\'92s, and doctorate degrees, and I took a while just as you\'92re doing. I did a lot of non-standard things that weren\'92t any good for some hypothetical career I\'92m supposed to have. I trained and competed in Judo and Jiu Jitsu for my entire 20s, got a black belt from it. I wrote a lot, including a lot of really crappy poetry. I read a large amount of non-technical books, history, philosophy, and literature. I took courses on literature and philosophy that weren\'92t at all required for my computer science and electrical engineering degrees, like a course on James Joyce. I played guitar in bars around town. I took a lot of technical classes, many, for example, on theoretical computer science that were way more than were needed for the degree. I did a lot of research and I coded up a bunch of projects that didn\'92t directly contribute to my dissertation. It was pure curiosity and the joy of exploring.\

\f1\b0 \cb3 \'a0Like you, I took the long way home, as they say, and I regret none of it. Throughout that, people around me and even people who love me wanted me to hurry up and to focus, especially because I had very little money, and so I had a sense like time was running out for me to take the needed steps towards a reasonable career. And just like you, I was filled with anxiety and I still am filled with anxiety to this day, but I think the right thing to do is not to run away from the anxiety, but to lean into it and channel it into pursuing with everything you got, the things you\'92re passionate about.\

Get to a good grad school, find a good advisor and do epic shit with them. And it may turn out in the end that your life will have unexpected chapters, but as long as you\'92re chasing dreams and goals with absolute unwavering dedication, good stuff will come of it. And also try your best to be a good person.
