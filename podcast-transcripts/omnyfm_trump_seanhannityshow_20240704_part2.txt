I spent a lot of time with President Trump this week at mar A Lago, and we played a lot of the interview. We'll have more of it that we have not aired on Hannity tonight nine eastern on the Vox News channel. But I want to play for you what I think was an extremely enlightening and informative interview on some very key issues, and we'll have a lot more tonight as he talks about Merrick Garland and the economy and so much more. That's nine eastern on Fox. But here's my interview with President Trump.\cb1 \

\cf2 \cb3 We just have breaking news, as I mentioned in my open tonight, and I want to get your reaction to the fact that the appeals Court has now stopped your Georgia case election case while appeal on Willis's disqualification is pending. This is on the heels of Florida Judge Eileen Cannon looking into whether or not the prosecutor, Jack Smith, the special prosecutor, was pointed in an inappropriate way which would render the case and the indictments out completely. That is going to take place in fairly short order. A lot can change in a couple of days, with only one hundred and fifty two days out of election.\cb1 \

And secondly, you were asked about the possibility that Judge Marshawn might send you to jail. He said something that really kind of got my attention. What did you say that It didn't phaze you in the sense that if that's what it takes, you don't have to be doing this.

And he's the worst president in the history of our country. But in the case that you're talking about, I said very strongly that I'm very proud to fight for our constitution and that's what it takes.

Janine was so incredible two weeks ago. She was unbelievable angry. She was angry. And you know why they're angry, because I love our country and they see what's happening. It's totally unconstitutional what they've done. And if you look at the statements made by the people I just mentioned, and I'm not friends with any I mean, I think they respect what I've done. They might respect me, they might not respect me. But they said there's no case. It shouldn't have been brought. And the way the judge charged the jury, told the jury, gave jury instructions.\cb1 \

\cf2 \cb3 Well, he said it, and then you found out it was absolutely untrue. Everything he says is untrue. There's never been a president like this. Look, he's a horrible president. He's destroying our country at the border. He's allowing millions of people to come in from prisons, in jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums, which is a step above, a big step above a mental institution. He's allowing terrorists to flood into our country. And the numbers are probably sixteen, seventeen or eighteen million people. You're gonna have over twenty million people. I think, I believe in a lot of other people do too. By the time he hopefully gets out, November fifth election day will be the most and by the way, it starts on September twenty second, it starts earlier because they're early voting, but November fifth will go down as the most important election in the history of our Country's going to be the most important day and period in the history of our country.\cb1 \

Yesterday, Joe Biden, who'd been telling America that the borders closed and the borders secure for over three years and his vice president said it, and his spokespeople had said it, and his Department Homeland Security secretary said it. Then all of a sudden, they wanted to blame Republicans. I don't have the power. Meanwhile, they did undo all of your policies with the stroke of a pen.

He was incredible guy, but he suffered it. And I've had many friends, but my brother suffered tremendously from this addiction. In fact, he was older than me, and he'd go out and say, never drink, Never ever drink. Now, in those days, drugs were not prevalent. You know, you didn't have that. But he'd say, never ever drink.

\cf2 \cb3 Most of it is ninety five percent coming through the southern border. I built five hundred and seventy one miles of wall, and I had the Mexican Army protecting us. I said, you're either going to protect us or are going to charge of big tariffs. And got along very well with the President of Mexico. They gave us tremendous protection. During the time, we had the best level of numbers. Nobody's ever had, numbers like the best we've ever had in terms of illegal immigration. In fact, my last week in office, we had less people coming into our country than it any time before. But importantly we also had drugs were down nineteen percent, twenty percent, and that's not enough. And by the way, you'll never really solve the drug problem unless you do what other countries do, and that's the death penalty for drug dealers. Whether you have the death a drug dealer or average will kill during that person's life, five hundred people. Unless you have a death penal, unless there's a something that there right now, they don't even get charged with anything. If you don't institute the death penalty for drug dealers, you'll never solve that problem. You'll get it down to a number that like I got it down actually at one point it was twenty two two percent down. That was a good thing, but you'll never solve the problem. We set up committees, we set up all of this. The cartels are run by very smart, very vicious people. They're pouring drugs into our country now. The number coming in now compared to four years ago is twelve times higher.\cb1 \

\cf2 \cb3 My brother was a strong person. I've had friends that were so strong, so powerful, they couldn't stay away from it. Last of alcohol, they couldn't stay away from a drug. They had to have a drug. But you know, the way that you solve the problem, don't have them if you don't have a taste for alcohol. I remember when I was going to school college, I had a friend he hated the taste of scotch. Hated it. It was like, but he wanted to develop it because socially he thought it was a good thing. You know, I sit down with the bankers and you know, all the Wharton School of Finance. They want to have dinners with bankers, right, that's a big thing, and they want to He developed this taste for scutch and by the time he finished, he ended up being a very bad alcoholic. I mean twenty twenty five years later he ended up being an alcoholic and he couldn't stay away. I say, the way you stay away just don't drink, Just don't have it. If you don't have drugs, if you don't experience early on, you're not going to have a need for it. You're not going to have an addiction. If you don't drink alcohol, you're not going to have an addiction. You're not going to have this insatiable urge to have a drink. And I say that to people with your children. They asked me, what do you think of children? What do you tell them? I say, no drugs, no alcohol. I also say no cigarettes. Don't have the cigarettes. Don't have cigarettes. Don't have them. I have friends they can't stop smoking. If they never had a cigarette before, that have no problem. When I look at a friend that can't stop smoking, I don't understand why.\cb1 \
