\f0\b \cb3 1:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that is Secretary of Defense Austin leaked\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 there are no suspects so far and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin didn't rule\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 out the possibility of an\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 intentional leak by the administration this\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 for their rocket attack a month ago\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Number two You know the main thing to me\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is you gotta vote you gotta vote. Voting early\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I guess would be good but you know people\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have different feelings about it but the main thing\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is you gotta get out you gotta vote and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'll be voting early I'll be voting early Wow\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that's a huge change I talked to President\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump for about a half hour you're gonna\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 get all of it next hour while the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Harris well Harris seems to fall\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 apart on NBC as she struggles to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 define and defend spend her programs\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and policies while taking the rest of the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 day off. You'll hear my full\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump interview today. Number one. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think he's had some very strong\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 issues in swing states, doing the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 auto workers in Michigan, fracking in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Pennsylvania, and no tax on\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 tips in Nevada. I think it's been a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 clever campaign in all those respects. And so\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think he's got the edge.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Yup, 13 days and counting. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Mark Penn, a Democratic pollster,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 says this, on election day it looks\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 pretty good right now for the president.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 He's winning, but he hasn't won. VP\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Harris, light schedule. Meanwhile, Biden rages\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and hurts Harris again. I don't\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 even know if it's intentional or\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he's just losing it more than\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 ever, and I don't think the governor's on. I don't even\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think he's got a staff with him. Kelly\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 McEnany, co-host of Outnumbered, former White\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 House press secretary. And Kayleigh,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you were with Trump when he lost. We had\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to finish out those final weeks, famously. People\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 talk about January 6th. But what\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 2:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 changes when they know you're not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 coming back? Yeah, when\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they know you're not coming back, you're a lame\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 duck president and you have people who leave, you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have people who talk to reporters, and we're seeing\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this with Joe Biden. I mean,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he had a former staffer come out, which is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 less surprising. You're no longer in the administration. In\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the wake of his comments about jailing Trump, which\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he clarified him in politically, I'll\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 leave viewers or listeners to decide about that. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 there was a current administration official who\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 told a reporter, and this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is often a leak-free White House, but told\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a reporter that no one listens to him\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 anymore. That's what happens when you're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a lame duck president. It's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 stunning because you know, Brian, this has been\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a pretty good airtight administration in terms of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 leaks. Right. But he's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 so bitter, obviously, you saw the funeral\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 for Ethel Kennedy. He's obviously bitter that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he's not there. He's really trying to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 put together again how he got ousted,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sees that she's no longer, you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know, surging, plateaued, and maybe dipping\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and thinking, why am I not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 3:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 there again? I didn't you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know, she's not that good. So he's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 having trouble processing this. Yeah, how\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 could you not be bitter? This is a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 president who began his administration with I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 defeated Donald Trump. I took him down\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 He was meeting with historians because he wanted\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to be like FDR and he grilled historians\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 about how he could achieve FDR like status\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 He probably imagined his name on his face\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on Mount Rushmore one day and now\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 anyone will remember the Biden presidency solely\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and simply right as the guy who\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 stepped aside amid mental acuity issues That\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is his legacy and he's got to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 be thinking could it be different? Do\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we think that second half? I think people\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 at their dinner table and at their tailgate\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 say yeah mental acuity issues, but no one\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 says it No one says it. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was gonna be one term I maybe I should be one\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the only reason you're one term or is because you got\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 ousted by Nancy Pelosi I personally think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the story is gonna be With they\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 predicted everything except for that Harris would\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 get the nomination They wanted a jungle\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 primary where Harris would be one of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 4:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the people Clyburn even said\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in one of the Sunday shows she should be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 one of the people considered Okay,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 if Clyburn was saying that Well,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we'll see the other big story That\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 came out. I believe is On\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the Atlantic magazine story John Kelly speaking\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 out and coming out and saying basically\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that Donald Trump Were\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 liked Hitler and often says he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wanted him He wish he had\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Hitler Hitler's generals at which time he described and say,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you know, a lot of times his generals were trying\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to kill him This Atlantic\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 story also includes someone whose\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 daughter was killed on Ford Hood and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 there's controversy there Can you frame\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it out for us? Yes, so this Atlantic story\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 popped last night and you know, I'm about to go\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to bed I'm joining you on Fox and Friends and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I see it and The headline\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is about exactly as you described and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it has a anecdote about the Guillain\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 family You noted the daughter was killed\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 at Fort Hood And it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 said that President Trump disrespected this family is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the gist of it and I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 5:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 look at the author and it's Jeffrey Goldberg and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think oh I know that name. That\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is the name of the individual who\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wrote the suckers and losers story which\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 happened when I was press secretary and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in hours we gathered more than a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 dozen individuals who said that is not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 true. Several who were eyewitnesses, one of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 which Zach Fuentes, an aide to John\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Kelly who you mentioned, said he never\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 said suckers and losers. Also other parts\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of the story were discredited with contemporaneous\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 documents I brought to the podium. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this is the individual who peddles anonymous\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sources weeks before an election to try\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to affect the outcome in my view that's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 his goal and then this Guillen story family\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 breaks. I was in the first meeting with\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the Guillen family not the second one in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 December he talks about but the family it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was shown so much love and respect by\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump. The sister has come out and said\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Donald Trump has shown me nothing but love\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and respect. I in fact voted for him\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 today. So once again here you have the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Atlantic trying to sway an election weeks before\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 CBS leading with the story. It is malpractice\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in my opinion. She says Myra\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Guillen, sister of Vanessa Guillen, says\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 6:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I don't appreciate how you're exporting\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 my sister's death for politics. It's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 hurtful and disrespectful to the important\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 changes she made for service members.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 President Trump did nothing but show respect\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 for my family and Vanessa. In\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 fact I voted for President Trump. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that good luck with that.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 They love it on CNN and MSNBC but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 at least take a step back. Look at\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the guy's track record. You see the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 way he cares about people whether it's a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 slain officer or it's a child. You see\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the empathy that he has which they claim\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he doesn't possess. General John\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Kelly I guess when contacted as\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 former chief of staff and never\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 fond of the president said this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 cut 28. Certainly the former president\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is in the far right\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 area certainly an\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 authoritarian admires\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 people who are dictators. He\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 has said that. So he certainly falls\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 into the general definition\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 7:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of fascist for sure.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 If he was left to his own devices would he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 be a dictator if he didn't have people around him?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Oh, I think he'd be Love to be I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think you'd love to be just like he was in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 business. He could tell people to do things and they would\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do it and And not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 really bother too much about whether What\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the legalities were? General\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Kelly your comments because you would kill you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 were there too. Yes. Don't know John\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Kelly He was before my time. But what I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do know is the Trump presidency It\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was not fascist you could judge it for yourself\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 In fact when you look at all the polling\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 people are fond of the Trump presidency. They remember\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 better times There were no new wars. There was\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Middle East peace. Did you see a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 fascist? I certainly didn't I see another party that wants\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to pack The courts I see another\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 party that used the DOJ to go after\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump lawlessly and pro\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 lifers Nonetheless targeting that group\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I see a lot of lawlessness on\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the other side I did not see that with\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Donald Trump. Can I can I can\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 8:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 everyone out there understand that every president?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 That you read about a study wrestle\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 with the fact that they can't get things done\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 exactly like they want it through the Constitutional systems\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 with the democracy that we have there are things\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that got to pass there are things that are\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 executive orders There's legislation that's got to be done.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Sometimes you have Two demo\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 two Democratic body houses a house\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in Senate and you're a Republican\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 president or vice versa and there\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is frustration You'll always hear that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the Democratic president talking to a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 dictator like the president of the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 president of China Or the leader\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of Russia and they'll say you know, I gotta see if I can\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 get this done I don't know if I could get it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 done. I don't I get that treaty ratified. That doesn't mean\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he wants to be a dictator It means what\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Kelly just said he came from\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a world for 50 years Where\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was a family business like huge\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 one? But he just basically talked\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to his friends and family about\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 executing his vision Obviously, this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is something that he needed some adjusting. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 9:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 don't think it means He wants to be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Mussolini. Yeah, I saw a former cabinet\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 secretary of Donald Trump's last week, and he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was giving a talk, and I was listening\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to the talk, and he said something\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to the effect of private sector\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mentality is not rewarded in federal\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 government. If anything, people\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are hesitant to bring that to federal government,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 because what happens is you end up having\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 an inspector general on you. There's all kinds\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of investigations, because you're trying to do\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 something different, and it upsets the career. Politicians,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it upsets the career. Donald\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump came in with a new and a fresh way\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of thinking. It upset a lot of people. It upset the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 bureaucrats, it upset some of the generals. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 what did you get? You got economic\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 prosperity, and you got peace around the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 world. The private sector mentality worked. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to your point, Brian, there are a lot of people who\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 don't get that, and I guess you can't fault them, because\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they've been doing this their whole life a certain way, but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it worked. So Anderson Cooper needed\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a lead, so John Kelly provided it,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and here it is, cut 30. He\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 cut it more than once. Hitler did\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 10:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 some good things, too, and of course, if\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you know history, again, I think he's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 lacking in that. But if you know\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 what Hitler was all about, it would be pretty\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 hard to make an argument that he did anything\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 good. So he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 went on to say, you know, Hitler's generals kept trying\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to kill him. So they'd have private conversations, and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Hitler did some good things. That according to him,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he said, he brings that out\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 now. Why would you bring that out now?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 It's 13 days before an election when\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 all of a sudden the former president\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is surging. Yeah, I never heard him\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 say anything like that, never, ever, ever in my\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 hundreds of interactions. I don't know why. Look,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 but I know President Trump, to my point, did\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 things differently. He called Kim\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Jong-un, Rocket Man, on Twitter. I'm sure the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 generals probably were a little apprehensive about that,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 but look what it did. You\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 ever wanted him to meet one-on-one with him? Exactly. He\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would pick up the phone, and he would talk\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to Putin. Biden hasn't done that, and there's a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 colorable argument. Ukraine wouldn't have happened if there would\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 11:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have been a second term because Donald Trump made\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 relationships with both foes and friends and it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 worked and you didn't have Russia redrawing the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 map and invading a sovereign country. I don't\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think you would have seen October 7th. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think right now we'd be sitting here with\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a Saudi Arabia Middle East peace deal and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Iran totally iced out in the Middle East.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 But the way Donald Trump got there was\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 upsetting to a lot of people. The rocket\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 man, the back and forth. This is unconventional\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 but maybe you need a little unconventional. Kayleigh,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in your estimation being that you've been\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on every side of it. You've been a commentator, you know\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you're an anchor, you've been an insider\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and then you also have been working for campaigns\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and you also know Trump. Can\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this move needle on the few people\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that are undecided? Absolutely not.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I don't think so. Look, there\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are independent Nikki Haley voters. Yes,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that can be moved but I think what you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are going to see based on the reporting that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I've noticed is that Nikki Haley is going to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 come out in my estimation and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 make a powerful argument on behalf of Donald Trump.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think you'll see them on the campaign together.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 12:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 There is no one who could bat down\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 an argument better than this than Nikki Haley\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 who sat at the UN who observed Donald\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump day-to-day and I believe no\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 inside sourcing here but I believe she's gonna\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do that and I think it's going to be very powerful. Would\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it be on MSG on Sunday? Oh,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 well first of all Brian I never questioned your\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 political instincts because you predicted what happened this week,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 last week and I think you just predicted what's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to happen next week, this week. Well\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I mean it would be interesting because at first you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 might be like well that's the rival of Trump, well\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 she rebooted but she wasn't, she was greeted\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 nicely at the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 RNC and you might say\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 just to button it up the rest of the Republicans, what\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do they say? 8% or\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 10% are not voting for Trump Republicans,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 less than that for Democrats, so\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would that be a good place to come\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 out? I asked him and you'll hear this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 next hour, are you doing this on the 27th as a New\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Yorker to culminate three campaigns and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the end of campaigning for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 an office and he said I never thought about\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 13:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it but for New\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 York workers, I think around\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the country, MSG is something special. It's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 an iconic building called the Mecca. It\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 means a lot to a guy that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sat in the front row and watch\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the Nixon Rangers and Billy Joel for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 years. It's very smart look when\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump makes a stop that doesn't make sense\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and that it's not in a swing state.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 It does make sense nationally Aurora, Colorado, there\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is a specific immigration reason he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was there coach Ella has a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 lot of pop culture pizazz to it. MSG\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 has a certain notoriety and I think you're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to see networks cover it and it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 gets social media traction in a way that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 maybe one stop in Wisconsin would not I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think in hindsight these are pretty brilliant. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 can't speak for Kamala going to Texas and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Tim was going to Kentucky though does it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 surprise you that in 3 hours they had\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the invitations it was MSG was sold out.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Not surprising in the slightest there's a lot of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 pent-up energy here for Trump. I've\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 seen Trump signs and places you and think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you see him around the New York Metro\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 area not surprised that pent-up energy was channeled\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 14:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 into a swamping of Madison Square\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Garden. You went for 3 hours with\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 me to 20 minutes with me. Yes, but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you in 2 and a half hours are going\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to be doing out numbered you have any ideas\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on your show. I have as you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 probably know time to study. I talked to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 my producer in the middle of your show\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and now I get avocado toast at the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 little Fox Cafe. I go\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 prep for outnumbered and I'll be ready to go\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Brian, I'm always ahead of the game. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that's true because carbs on the day of the game. Absolutely\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 easy to burn. I mean I didn't\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do the big like the done the bagel at least\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a little avocado spread on top that nullifies the car,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you know kill you kill me for the longest\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 time I said give me and everything flat right.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 That's good right then they said to me right\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 15:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you're not saving anything because you still you still\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 16:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you know it's interesting i i really\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 feel i'm very mixed and i i\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have the old standard of uh...\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the tuesday vote and all a lot of people\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 like the vote and i'm really make you know\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the main thing to me is you got a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 vote you got a vote of voting early i\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 guess would be good but you know people have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 different feelings about it but the main thing is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you gotta get out you gotta vote and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 i'll be voting early i'll be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 voting early in florida i guess you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 voted early in the primary to so donald\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 trump has to be pleased with some of the numbers\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of people voting early because if you look at the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 value look at pennsylvania of the numbers away ahead where\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they were in twenty twenty and remember that the theory\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is is a strong one it's going to be the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 same this time that is the republicans\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 win an election day and if democrats are going\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to win is going to be the voting early\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 vote not usually the military vote was going\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to be those who do you know uh...\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mail-in voting and the ones who do\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 early voting donald trump stopped\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 everything when he said don't vote early i don't know\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 what's gonna happen your ballot don't let them screw with\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 17:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 your ballot vote on election day That\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wasn't as good strategic move. Everyone knew it. Plus,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it was during the pandemic and a lot of older\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 people said, I'm not going to go stand online with\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 big crowds. I like to mail it in. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 then when you saw all the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 ballots just show up in people's mailboxes\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 or in apartment buildings, people say, yeah, well,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that looks like those ballots are ready to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 be thrown away. I'm not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to let that happen to my ballot. Then\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you also had drive-through balloting, which is bizarre. Imagine\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a family of five. The father pulls up, tells\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 everybody else who to vote for, and then hand\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 up the envelopes and their Dodge Dart and say,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 there you go. So it was\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a lot different last time. This\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 has already proven different this time. If\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you're interested in it, Brian's talking\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 about it. You're with Brian Kilmeade.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 You never saw anything like what happened at\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the debate night behind closed doors with him? It\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 18:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was a bad debate. People have bad debates.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 He is absolutely, but that's the reason why\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you're here. And he's not running\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 for the top of the ticket. Well,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you'd have to ask him if that's the only reason\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 why. What do you think? I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 am running for president of the United States. Joe Biden\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is not. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 my presidency will be about bringing\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a new generation of leadership to America\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that is focused on the work\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that we need to do to invest in the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 ambitions and aspirations of the American people. What\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a ridiculous answer. Why could\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you ever be direct? Do you know this is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 an audition for the job? That was an interview\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 with Haley Jackson,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Halle Jackson, and asked\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a normal question that you and I have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 been asking all the time, but nobody asked\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 her. Why are you even the person? Why\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are you the vice president? We hear about\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you making pancakes for your grand nieces and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they want more bacon. And he had a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 call from Joe Biden that he's not going\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to run. You thought great and OK. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 19:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 so I guess I'll. run. No,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 what happened behind the scenes was\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a Jerry McGuire-like frantic push to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 round up delegates and block off\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would-be contenders in order for you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to get the nomination in this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 historic pullout, thanks to the pressure\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 from George Clooney, Nancy Pelosi, and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 most of all Barack Obama. That's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the story. And just saying, I got\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a call from Joe saying he's out, you have to ask him,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is not going to suffice. When\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 does she realize she's got to be somewhat\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 candid? You're going to blame Brett Baer for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 asking too many questions. You're going to blame\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 NBC, they're not nice enough to you. My\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 goodness, Rich Lowry of National Review.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Rich, what's going on here? I mean,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 there's so many questions that even friendly\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 networks are asking them and she\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 can't answer and she's stunned by\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the content. Yeah, I think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's another case where she can't answer\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 just because the answer would be too devastating. She'd\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have to say she's being sincere and honest. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 knew all along and we're just going to try\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 20:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to lie our way through it and then we\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 got caught. That's why I'm the nominee.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 But of course she can't say that.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 So she has to dance around it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and say, I defer to Joe and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 who knows. But it's the same thing\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on the border. It's not as though\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 she couldn't, not capable of giving a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 decent answer on the border. She doesn't want to give\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a decent answer because again, it would\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 be too devastating. Look, we blew it up\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 deliberately. It was a huge mistake. We\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 violated the law and I promise not to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do that in the future. That\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would be a reasonable answer, but it'd\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 be a devastating one. So instead she has\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to try to evade and obfuscate and she's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 not going to get any clearer on any\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of this stuff in the next 13 days.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 So Mark, you mean came out and says because\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 their hearts were too big letting refugees come into\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the country. I never saw heard a more ridiculous\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 answer in my life. Have you?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Well, I do think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they do have this this moral view. It's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 twisted, but they think it's a moral view\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 21:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that basically borders are You're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 intolerant and maybe a little racist if you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 want to enforce them. So there's this whole\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 category of people, asylum seekers, even if they're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 bogus asylum seekers, that we don't have a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 right to exclude. So it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 does go to some sort of moral view,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 or at least how they view their hearts.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 But it's been a debacle, and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they didn't acknowledge it. Again,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's like Biden being caught at the bait. They\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 didn't acknowledge it until they were caught. And finally,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Dawn and them, oh, we're running against Donald Trump.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 His signature issue is the border, and we're going to get killed on this. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 then they try to do something. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I've kind of heartened her. It looks like she was\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 catching up a little bit on the border, but the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 polling lately shows that Trump continues to kill her on\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that. So you know it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a subtle issue, but a major issue is this transgender\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 issue, where the taxpayers should be paying for prisoners to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 get sex changes. Obviously,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to Americans, forget\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 about party is of course not.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And should you be as a male who\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 22:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wants to be a female playing in women's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sports, the answer for a logical person is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of course they should not be playing in men's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sports. But she can't even answer it. When\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 confronted with this, listen to this. Cut 12. Do\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you believe that transgender Americans should have access\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to gender-affirming care in this country? I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 believe we should follow the law. I mean,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think you're probably pointing to the fact that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Donald Trump's campaign has spent tens of millions of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 dollars. They're trying to define you on\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this. Yes. I'm asking you to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 define yourself, though. Just broadly speaking, what is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 your value? Do you believe they should have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that access? I believe that people, as the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 law states, even on this issue about federal\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 law, that that is a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 decision that doctors will make in terms of what\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is medically necessary. I'm not going to put myself in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the position of a doctor. She\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 kidding? No. I'm\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 kidding. I'm not going to put myself in the position as\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a doctor. Well,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 she did. She was perfectly comfortable to do it three\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 or four years ago, right? So what changed? She\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 did this on the border, too, with Brett. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 23:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 just want to\'97 It\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was the case to actually\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 eliminate, physically eliminate, shoot,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 kill someone who is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a, he really needs to be a threat to. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mean, so I know this sounds\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 bizarre. It sounds like I said this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 five years ago, you'd lock me up. We\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 got to lock him up. Political\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 rock came out. Lock\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 him out. That's what we have to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do. I have so much to say on this, Rich,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 but you're my guest. You get to go first. Politically\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 lock him up. What does that mean? Right?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 The politically is a save. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this is the classic Freudian flip.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Yes. I mean, it's what Democrats\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 believe, right? It's what they wanted to do. It\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 didn't work, but they at least would have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 had him in the courtroom entirely from March\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to October. Maybe the last trial will be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 ending today for all we know, and they'd\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 put him in jail if they could. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 much happened. I mean, think about this. This is two\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 days after Nathan Wade admitted he met with the Department\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 26:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of Justice and the White, been at the White House\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 three different times talking about this case, the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Georgia case. This is the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 time in which Jack Smith was hired by an\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 attorney general who the current\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 president lamented that America\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 enacted too slowly, should have indicted\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 President Trump and got\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 him through court a lot earlier. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mean, he shows it. Remember in 2016\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 when Trump won, he was in the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Oval Office with Obama as they essentially\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 found out they started planting the whole\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Russia investigation and covering their tracks. He\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was sitting right there. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this whole thing was Freudian. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the other ridiculous statement, which I don't know what's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 worse, if he believes it or\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he doesn't believe it and said it,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the Supreme Court ruling on immunity allows\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 him to shoot somebody, kill\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 someone he believes he'll be able to get away\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to it or threaten to kill him and be able to get\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 away with it. There's nothing up. This\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 guy's a lawyer. There's nothing about that ruling\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that says he can go shoot somebody, but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 27:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he's telling another group of vulnerable\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 people that if you elect Donald\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump, he's going to kill people\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and be immune for prosecution. Yeah,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's absurd. What will happen with that ruling? It\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 happens with all the Supreme Court rulings like that.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Democrats will say, oh, it's the worst ruling ever.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And then some Republican prosecutor will try to go\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 after Biden or if Kamala Harris wins and is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 out in four years after Harris. And then they'll\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 get protected by this ruling and all of a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sudden the ruling will be great. It\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 doesn't say Donald Trump is immune. It\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 says presidents and Donald Trump is not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to be our only president ever\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 again. You know, so it's so short-sighted\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and it just goes to the rank\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 fear mongering of the other side. I'm\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 pretty struck. Maybe you have so much\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 more experience with this, but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm just struck about the negativity coming out and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the attacks through the surrogates on Trump. Trump's always\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 been tough and brusque. That's the way he's always\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to be. Rosie O'Donnell\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 or Kim Jong-un.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 That's the way he is. Oh, you got attacked?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm not attacking back. Listen to the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 28:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 man, listen to the man representing the party of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 joy. Cut 19. When\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he's not complaining, when he's not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 doing some strange tweet, he's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 trying to sell you stuff. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mean, who\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is hawking merch when\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they're running for president? I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mean, he's trying to sell you golden sneakers. He's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 trying to sell you a hundred\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 thousand dollar watch. Says it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 made in Switzerland, but nobody\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 really knows. So he's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 just going off, just going off on him.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I can't believe this guy is winning. Yeah.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 So this is kind of the part\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of the Obama MO is mockery. You\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know, he did a lot of it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in 08 and 12, but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's just the joy campaign is over, right?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 They had the cliche was a sugar high.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think that was right. The media was\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 so on the tank and Democrats are so\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 relieved to be done with Biden that they\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 could do this joy thing for a pretty\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 29:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 long time, especially in a short.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 campaign but that that phase is gone\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that's worn off and and now they're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 just going hammering tongs after Trump. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I want you to hear what Mark\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Penn said a Democratic poster for Hillary\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and Bill Clinton. I find\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 him very interesting he doesn't care who he's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 being interviewed by he's just gonna hit you with the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 facts and this is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 how he sees the race at this moment. Here\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is, if I could just find\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it, yeah here's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Mark Penn. I think Donald Trump\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 has an edge. I would not count Kamala\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Harris out at this point but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think he's got an edge\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 because he's winning on all the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 major issues. I think he's had\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 some very strong issues in swing\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 states doing the auto workers in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Michigan fracking in Pennsylvania and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 tips no tax on tips in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Nevada. I think it's been a clever campaign and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 all those respects and so I think he's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 got the edge. So that's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 how he sees it. Is that how you see\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 30:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it Rich? Yeah I totally agree\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's what I thought all along that that he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 had had the edge because people\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are so discontented with status quo and he's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 leading on the major issues\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the economy inflation and the border and you know\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's not a massive change but you can see\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it kind of tipping his way in these\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in these swing states and some\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 national polling as well so\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I kind of think he's gonna win but look\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's a margin of error race in every single\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 swing state so if there's a polling era\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 looking out there for Harris or for Trump\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 or one of them turns out more people\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 than then we expect it could you know\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 tip one way and it kind of a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 big electoral college result but as close than\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 16 is close than 20 I think it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 gonna be close again this year but I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 give the advantage to Trump. Lastly\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 what's your prediction on what Israel is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to do to Iran? I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 don't know I think it's unknowable I think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they they you know who of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 us would have would have predict oh they're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 gonna explore the pagers of Hezbollah operations right\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 31:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and make a profit with And the company,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the cutout company, those manufacturing these things,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they're so good. They have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 been so subtle and effective.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 The last five or six\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 weeks, I have no idea what\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they are going to do, but I would not be sleeping\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 very easily if I'm a terror operator in Iran. Yes.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I just think that the whole region, I think on\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 some level, is rooting for them to take out the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 nuclear program, except for President\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Biden. And I can't get my head\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 around that. I know he doesn't want a world war, but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the best way to stop is to do that. Yeah.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Everything would have played out differently if Iran had had\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a bomb. Israel going\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 up Hezbollah, they'd be hesitant to do\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it because what if it makes Iran\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 launch against\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 them? You know, deterrence\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 doesn't just stop someone from\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 launching a nuclear weapon. It stops you from\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 doing things short of that. So the whole\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 environment would be different. It's totally intolerable for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Iran to get a weapon. And it's just\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 32:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 bizarre. After the first two\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 or three weeks after October 7th, the administration\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 has been bent on restraining Israel from\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 doing the things that it needs to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do. And then when it works out,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they're like, oh, we're happy with that,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 but stop now. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's bizarre. Sometimes you need to take your\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 own side in a fight. And these people\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are our enemies too. Right. The\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 word surrender, not ceasefire. Mail and ballots, you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 said, are in a national embarrassment. Why? Do\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you need to count them until after the election? Yeah,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 like, Florida has a lot of mail-in ballots. It's not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the system I would prefer, but it's the world we\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 live in. And they process them before the election.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Then they count them on election day. And you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know the result by, you know, an\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 hour or two after the polls close.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Pennsylvania doesn't process them until election day.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 It's complicated. You got to take them\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 out of envelopes, confirm envelopes, unfold the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 ballots. And it takes days.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 So I think if it depends on Pennsylvania, which\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 isn't a crazy bet, obviously, we might not know\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 until Saturday again. Wow. Rich\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Lowry, National Review. It's an exciting time, Rich. Thank you.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 33:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Awesome. I know you have a lot to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 34:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 father-son duo to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 34:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you go. The LeBron James. LeBron\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 34:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 James has another record playing with his son. 20\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 34:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 years old. Hopefully he can work\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 out. He did not have a low-in-college career. He\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 had a mini-stroke before\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 his freshman year. Was able to play the second\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 half of the year at USA and then decided\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to go pro. With the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Lakers up 51-35 he checked into the game.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 So congratulations they made history.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Here's the Bronnie talking about playing with his dad.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 What will you remember most about tonight? Going\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 up to that sports day with my dad. Checking in for the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 first time. That's a crazy moment I will never\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 forget. As you checked in and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you realized this lifelong dream. What\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 did you realize about accomplishing that? I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mean I'm just extremely grateful for everything. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was given an amazing opportunity to come in this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 league and get better every day and learn every\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 day. So I'm just\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 extremely grateful. Right here's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 LeBron. Huge smile across\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 your face. You have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 accomplished many milestones. You have made\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 history countless times. Why is this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 feat so special? It's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 35:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 family. I've always been family over everything\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and you know for me\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I lost a lot of time because\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of this league and committing to this league being\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on the road at times missing a lot of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 his things, Bryce's things, Jerry's things. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to be able to have this moment where I'm working\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 still and I can work alongside my son is one\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of the greatest gifts I've ever got from the man\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 above and I'm gonna take full advantage of it. Yeah\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and I hope his son does. Meanwhile\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this Spanish Women's Soccer Club has\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sparked outrage after fielding two bearded\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 guys who are transitioning from female\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to male including one who scored\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 one of the winning goals. The\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 transgender uproar exploded when club\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Esperanza took on a European\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 team and these two guys took the field.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 So get this, so the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 women were becoming men so they're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wearing beards. Is that part\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of the transition process? I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 don't know. The fact that there's people with beards\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 playing women's soccer is just mind-blowing.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Certainly not attractive. Not why\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 36:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I watch it. Hi\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 everyone, I'm Brian Kilmeade. Welcome back to the Brian\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Kilmeade Show on this Wednesday. In\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the afternoon before the John Kelly\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 story broke in the Atlantic, I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 had a chance to sit down,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 excuse me, talk to the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 former President of the United States. Here's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a listen. It's my pleasure to bring back\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on to the Brian Kilmeade Show the 45th President of the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 United States who wants to be the 47th President\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Donald Trump. Mr. President, how do\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you feel with just 13 days to go? Can\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you believe it? First of all, all this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 time, all these years, all this work, but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I feel very good. She's taking the day off and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 she's taking another day off. I don't believe it. I've\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 gone 52 days in a row and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 another 13 days left and I'm just\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 37:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 leaving to make a big speech. North\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Carolina and just I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 feel very good. If you look at\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the early voting, which you know\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 as well as anybody, it's looking very,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 very strong. I think it's people are\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 voting for us at levels that no\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Republican has ever seen before. Republicans\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 tried to stay away from early voting. You\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 were unsure about, especially in 2020, Florida started\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 voting. Are you going to vote early? Kind\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of set an example or do you want\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to set an example on voting day? Yeah,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm very mixed on it. I mean,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm okay with the Tuesday voting, which\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they like doing Republicans like. And I'm\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 also, I say the main thing\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I say is vote. But ideally, I guess a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 lot of people would like to see early voting,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you know, where you stand a little bit. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm okay either way, Brian, really, I really am.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 When you talk about stuff that you're doing, word\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is out that you're going to sit down with\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the number one podcaster in the country, Joe Rogan.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 You've met him a couple of times. Why\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is this the right time to do the interview? It's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to go about three hours. That's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 38:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a huge commitment with a guy with everything's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in play. Well,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I don't know. I think he talked about doing it.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And I don't know, we talked about it for a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 long time. And I think he's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a nice guy. I've met him a couple of times\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 at the fights. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I don't know, it's that just seems something\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to do. It's no real strategy there, Brian.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I do it. And I do a lot of I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do a lot of shows, good, better and different. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do a lot of shows and they come out good.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 We're leading. We won the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Republican nomination in a record\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 time and the fastest anyone's ever\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 won it. And we were\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 doing very well now. We're up in the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 polls against this woman who's, you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know, and I say it loudly, she's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a low IQ person. We've had\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a low IQ person for the last four\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 years. We cannot afford to have it any\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 longer. And it's sort of it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 an amazing that when you have 13 days\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 left that somebody takes off and you're talking\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 about the presidency. That's not what we want\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 when you buy. And as\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 39:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 far as Rogan's concern, you know, I enjoy. get\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to listen too much. I don't have a lot of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 time to sit down and listen, but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think it might be very interesting. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think he's fantastic. I don't think he can go wrong.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And the one thing we have in common, I did\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the first few UFCs with Jim Brown when\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 no one knew what it was, and Joe\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Rogan helped make it, along with\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Dana White, one of the most successful franchises in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the world. I want you to hear, you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 talk about illegal immigration and migrants overrunning cities,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 like we have 66,000 here\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 right now. President Obama brought that up.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 He's the surrogate who is doing work\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 while the vice president does perhaps other\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 things or interviews. I want you to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 hear what he said. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the reason some people think, I don't\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know, I remember that economy when he first came\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in being pretty good. Yeah, it was\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 pretty good because it was my economy. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we'll talk about the illegal immigrants, what he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 said, but for there and the economy, is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that why your economy did good because you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 inherited Obama's? No, we\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 40:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 had a whole different thing, a whole different\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 philosophy. My economy did good because I got\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the tax cuts. I got the greatest tax\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 cuts in the history of our country. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that's what really spurred our economy. We had\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the best job numbers of any of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 anybody. We had the best. I had the best\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 economy in history and in the history of our\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 country. Does he deserve credit? Look at it. Yeah,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think I get credit for it. I do.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I get credit for that. I get credit for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the military. I get credit for not having gone\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 into a war. Right. You know, a lot of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 people thought I'd be in a war in 24\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 hours and we had peace through strength. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 did take over a mess that they\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 left me with ISIS and defeated them\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in rapid, in rapid time. You know,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we really did. I rebuilt the military.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 So you think Obama is correctly characterizing\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 your success, Mr. President? Do you think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that he is? No, but he doesn't.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 He doesn't characterize anything that's proper.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I mean, what he does, I will say\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 anything, anything that comes to mind as long\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 as it's positive for him. I mean, what\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he did, what he did to Biden was\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 pretty incredible. I watched the way he led\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 him off the stage and I will say.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 41:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 what he did to Biden was, I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think it was really terrible. So it was\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 terrible. They sabotaged Biden. Whether you like Biden\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 or not, he won the nomination and then\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they took it away from him. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 there's never been a time, there's never\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 been a time where this happened. He\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 certainly sounded upbeat. More with Donald Trump,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 who's gonna be running through the tape\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 with a very, very busy schedule, which\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 looks to be much busier than the vice presidents.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 More with Donald Trump in just a moment. Newsmakers\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and newsbreakers. Here\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 at first on the Brian Kilmeade\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Show. Welcome\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 back everybody. Brian Kilmeade here, as promised. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 had a full 30 minutes unedited, uninterrupted with President\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Donald J. Trump. After the break, as I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 told you, we're gonna have more. Guess what? It's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 after the break and here's more. So I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 want to talk about what's happening in foreign policy.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Right now Russia's hosting this BRIC Summit. It\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 includes China, India, Brazil, South\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Africa, Russia, obviously UAE, Ethiopia,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 42:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Iran. Together they\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 represent 20% of the world economy,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 43% of the world's population. Is that a threat to the G7?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And are you calling on our allies like India\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and UAE to drop out of it and Turkey\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to stay out of it? I'm\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 not calling on anything. I think it's a threat. It's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 always a threat. But the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 reason that threat is there is because Biden\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and Kamala are so pathetic as leaders.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 They're the worst administration in the history\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of our country. Jimmy Carter looks brilliant\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 by comparison. I mean, they are the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 worst. There's never been anything like this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 administration. They are incompetent. They don't know\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 what they're doing. And we'll end up\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in World War III over these people.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 So, I mean, I don't, you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know, I'm just blaming them because frankly, if\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we had a real president, if we had\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a president that knew what he was doing\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and a vice president that could help, and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 she's worse than him, she's worse than him.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I really believe that. I think she'll be actually worse than him.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 But you do look at Brix as a threat, and that's something\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 43:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you want to address because they want to get more. the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 dollar, the de-dollarization is what Russia\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wants to do. Will you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 push- Well, I'll solve that as soon as I get\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in, and I will solve it very strong and very\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 nicely, and it won't happen. There's no\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 way we get off the dollar. If we get\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 off the dollar, that's like losing a world war.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 That would make us a third world country.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Losing the dollar, losing the status\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of the dollar would be a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 loss almost of a world war,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and it's not going to happen. If I'm president,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's not. Now it'd be nice if\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they could start today instead of January 20th,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 but you're right, that is a threat to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the dollar, and it's a threat militarily. That's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a big force you're talking about. And there's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 no reason for this. This should have never\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 happened. Before I even premise\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this, I know you believe, and there's indications\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you're right, that Ukraine would never have been\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 invaded if you had won the second term.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 However, there is a war going on, and you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 will inherit it if you win. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 right now, that's been confirmed, fighting\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 for Russia are North Korean soldiers\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 44:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and Chinese mercenaries. South Korea has\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 indicated if North Korea is going\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to fight, we'll go. What\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do you do about this, and is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 one of the things releasing the restrictions\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on the weapons that we give Zelensky\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to actually hit the people before who\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are hitting you? Because right now, they're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 restricted. Your thoughts? Well, you mentioned\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 at the beginning, just at the beginning of this question,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that I know\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it wouldn't have happened. It would not have happened,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and that's the sad part. So many people are\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 dead. So many people are killed. So many cities,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I mean, almost most of them\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are just laying on their sides, broken\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 up into smithereens. What a shame. Far\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 more people died, Brian, as you know.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 You see that. Far more people died. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's a horrible thing, and I hate what happened.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 But that is going to be your problem, Mr.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 President. No way it would have happened. It's going to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 be on the Resolute. Whoever the President is, it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to be on the Resolute desk. Top\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 priority. What do you do about that?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 It will be a top priority, and I'll get\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 45:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 both sides together, and I'll try and knock something\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sent into him and I think I'll\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 be successful. But it was a lot\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 easier before it started, that I can tell you. And think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of all the lives that were just\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wasted. It really\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was its Vladimir elected war, Vladimir\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Putin's elected war, and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he basically lost his Navy to a bunch\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of drones, Ted Zelensky. I think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they've been brilliant in many ways, but now they got\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 their hands full. They got two other countries fighting against\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 him. I wonder... You didn't see that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 coming. By the way, you didn't see\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that coming, Brian. You got other countries going and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you have an incompetent president and you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have an incompetent vice president. She's more\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 incompetent than he is. I want you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to hear what's happening. Elise Lachkin, Democrat,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Senator Casey, Democrat, are using you in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 their ads in a positive way. Listen. Tammy\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Baldwin got President Trump. The signer made in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 America, though. That's why he wrote a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 law signed by President Trump, forcing drug\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 companies to show their actual prices. Casey\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 bugged Biden to protect fracking, and he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sided with Trump to end NAFTA and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 46:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 put tariffs on China to stop them\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 from cheating. Do they deserve credit?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Well, you got two others because you have an\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Ohio that's happening and there's a couple of others\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 too. I guess it's a compliment, but I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 just hope it doesn't affect the race. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would imagine it's probably a compliment. Now\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they're all saying that we were with\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump on the tariffs. At least tariffs are\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 finally becoming popular. I'm not sure how you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 feel about it, but I will tell you,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 tariffs are going to make us rich\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 again. Tariffs are the way to go.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 It's my favorite word in the dictionary.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Outside of love and religion, Brian. Let's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 move to Israel. Israel has done the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 impossible. They've decapitated Hezbollah.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 They've released and located\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 their financing and told the Lebanese\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 where to find it. They also have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wiped out all but one battalion of Hamas,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 including their leadership. And now they've all been\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 promised and it's expected they're going to hit\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Iran. I know you've talked to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu over the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 47:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 weekend. giving\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 away intelligence, I know you're concerned about the leaking\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 or the hacking, whatever it is, what\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would you say to them about what site\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 should be hit or not hit inside Iran?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 It's sort of ironic the way you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 put that question because you say without\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 giving away intelligence, Ryan, our\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 intelligence or their intelligence has been\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 totally leaked. That was a massive\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 leak and somebody is a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 real enemy to have done that. They've\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 leaked the entire 70, whatever it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is, different plans and versions of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it to the world. Think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of it. How would you like\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to be Israel to wake up and find\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 out that all of your various plans on\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 attacking Iran have been leaked to the media\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and to the world? This\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 can only happen to this administration. This\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 group of people is just so bad. They think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it comes out of the Department of Defense, but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 who knows? Who knows? There's a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sentiment in this administration for Iran and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 does things change when you come in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 48:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 if you win? We're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to get everything straightened out. We're going to get Russia\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and Ukraine settled up. We're going to get them settled up.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 We're going to work like hell and I know you'd like\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to see that. I know how you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 feel about it and I fully understand how you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 feel about it. We're going to try and get\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that settled up and stop. We got to stop\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the killing, the death, all that death and horrible\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wasted death. It's so sad to watch. The\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 whole culture has been taken down because those cities\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are knocked down to the ground for the most\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 part outside of a few areas. You\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 look at those cities, every single building is, some\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of them magnificent, those magnificent golden towers\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and everything, they're all gone, blown to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 smithereens and far more\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 people than anybody knows. You're going to find\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that out. I am going\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to sit down with them and I know both of them very\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 well and I am going to try\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and get that thing done. I'm going to try and force\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a peace between them. With Israel,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that's actually in a certain way, you might\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 say it's more complicated but maybe not as difficult if\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you want to know the truth. It's probably a more\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 49:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 complicated situation. situation, but maybe not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 as difficult. But if Iran\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is the problem- Again, October 7th, you know, Brian,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think you would be believing in this. October\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 7th would have never happened. Iran was broke. They\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 didn't have money for Hezbollah. They didn't have money for Hamas.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 They had no money. They were absolutely\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 ... They would have made a deal.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And I would have made a deal that's good. I want to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 make a deal that's good for everybody. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we don't want Iran to have a nuclear\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 weapon. But if you look at your message\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to the Arab community, if you look at\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the Abraham Accords, there's really no administration that's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 done more. Maybe Jimmy Carter, when\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he brought Egypt to the table with Menachem Begin and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Anwar Sadat to bring the Arab\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 world together with Israel, then you guys.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 So is that the message to Michigan?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Well, I'll tell you, the message to Michigan really is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that if they would have gone with the Accords, so\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we have the four countries in, we're going to get\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a lot of countries. We're going to get those countries\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 back in there. The Abraham Accords\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was one of the greatest things that ...\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Maybe one of the greatest things, maybe the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 50:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 greatest that the Middle East has seen. It\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 can easily be filled out. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think it would have been filled out. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I even think there would have been a chance\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 at that time because Iran was not in a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 great negotiating position. And although I must say over\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the last four weeks, they're not in as good\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a negotiating position as they ...\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 They were. Would have been a long\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 time before. It's amazing what's happened. Now,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 had Israel listened to Biden, they\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would be waiting for a bomb to be dropped\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on their head right now. Think of it. There's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a theory that ... If they would have listened.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Yes, go ahead. There's a theory that the prime\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 minister, after meeting with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 said that if Trump is not to win,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 things are going to change dramatically. So I have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to win now. Do you believe he changed his\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 strategy after he came to the US and met\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 with them and she did not show up for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the joint session of Congress? I don't know. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he's been pretty much on his own. He\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 has not been listening to Biden. Biden\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wanted them to stop immediately fighting. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 if he did, you literally would be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 51:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 waiting for that. bombs to drop down\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on Israel. That's probably what would have happened.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And he's in a very strong position right\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 now. But with all of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that being said, we'll see what we can do in terms\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of getting peace. But he has really\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 put himself, Bibi's done a hell\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of a job of fighting, but he would\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 not listen to Biden. He wouldn't do it.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 He wouldn't listen to Biden. Don't forget when\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they made the original, you know, when the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 United States made the deal. They\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he came here. He was begging\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Obama in that time, Obama and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Biden, but basically Obama not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to make the deal a deal that I broke and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a deal that it was a great thing that I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 broke it. You know, if I didn't break that deal,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that the deal would be coming through right now. They'd\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 be able to it evaporates. Yeah, it would end. It\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would end in 10 years. The biggest problem with that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 deal was very short term. Yep. You know, everyone said,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 oh, I broke the deal. Of course I broke the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 deal. The thing would be coming due right now. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they would have a clear path to do it. There\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was in theory, nothing you could do about it. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it would have it would have been coming due right now\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 52:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is a very short term deal was a lousy deal. Whoever\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 made that deal, which I don't know made it. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that was a very bad deal for the United States.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 It was a really bad deal for Israel. And I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 terminated it. We'll work on all these\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 things. And you know, they're in flux because it's like, what\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are you going to do? Well, what am\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I going to do today is going to be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 what am I going to do tomorrow is going\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to be different, you know, because because it's changing\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 rapidly. Yeah. And right now you're running out to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 end Ukraine. I'd love to end the war\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 between Russia and Ukraine. I really think that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we got to get that one ended. I'd\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 love to see that ended. I thought\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it was it's been badly handled by everybody,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 including Biden. I mean, the Biden when he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 what he was saying at the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 time, there's no reason Russia right would have gone\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in. We would they would have never gone in.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And I hate to say that. Well, you know,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's been a disaster for Russia, too. They've lost\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 100,000 people. They've been isolated\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 economically and falling apart. But just to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 bring it back, bring it back locally or actually to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Israel real quick, they're going to hit targets. And it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to be in a matter of weeks. The sad\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 missile system is there. They got the arrow David sling\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 53:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and they have the Iron Dome. Now that it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in place and Iran has basically hit 150 rockets\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 their way and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's all but embracing for it. Would\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you like to see them hit the oil fields,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the nuclear fields, the military bases? Well, I don't\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 want to say because it puts me in a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 very bad position in terms of negotiating, but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a lot of people would say, let me put it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that way, that you hit the nuclear and you hit\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the oil. But I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 don't want to be the one to say that because I don't\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 want to get involved. And I do speak to BBA and I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 speak to a lot of people. And,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you know, from a negotiating standpoint, if I'm\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to be involved, but what people are\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 saying now, Biden is saying the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 exact opposite. Don't hit the oil and don't hit\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the nuclear. He's taking the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 opposite approach. Everything, you know, in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 history, Brian, if over the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 last 40 years you went the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 exact opposite of Joe Biden, every\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 single decision, the exact, even if\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you look at look\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 at the World Trade Center, let's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 54:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 not hit them, right? Let's not hit Osama\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 bin Laden. Yeah, you said, yeah, don't take\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 bin Laden. If you would\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 take the exact opposite of Biden every single\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 time you would have you would be one\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of the greatest foreign policy. Part\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of the reason why they seem to have just kicked him\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to the curb. Some more with Donald Trump right after this.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 You listen to the Brian Kilmeade show. Breaking\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 news, unique opinions here it all\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on the Brian Kilmeade show. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I hope you join the interview\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 with President Donald J. Trump as\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we get set 13 days and counting until it's all said\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and done. We went 30 minutes,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 took a couple of breaks here. Here's more\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of my interview, kind of exclusive\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 with the 45th president who really believes he's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 55:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 about to be the 47th. Something\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in New York that you can relate to,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and that's Danny Penny. This hero,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Marine, in my view, sees a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 problem on a subway car and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 used his training to subdue\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Jordan Nealey. Sadly, maybe\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 due to some drugs in the system, we\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 don't know, he loses his life. Now he's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on trial, at stake his freedom, maybe 15\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 years in prison. Your take\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on what he's going through and what would you like\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to see happen? Well,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I guess you have to look at the also\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the record of the other gentlemen.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 We're talking about like 30 or 35\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 arrests or something like that. It was\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 rough. You're going to have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to hear from the people in the subway\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 because they were very, very scared. They they\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 were, from what I understand, very scared.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And I'd have to look at it in a little\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 more detail, but it sounds to me like he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was very aggressive in the subway and they were\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 afraid for their lives. I assume\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they have some of those people testifying. So we'd have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 56:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to take a look at that. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's an awfully tough case, I think.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 It's an example of crime in the subway. I mean,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 there's always been crime in the subway in New York,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 especially in the 70s and 80s. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it is dangerous now. And as\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Good Samaritan standing up and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 now he's on trial when almost nobody else in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 New York, aside from you, is. The\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 other thing that comes to mind is you're going to be at\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Madison Square Garden. Now, October 27, it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to be Sunday already where reservations you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are sold out. Is this because\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the you look at as the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 perfect way to culminate three campaigns?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Well, I didn't think of it that way. We're really\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 looking to win New York if we can. We\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think there's a chance of winning New York\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 first time since, well, a long time, many,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 many decades. And we think there's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a real chance with what's going on with the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 migrants taking over the city, taking over the whole\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 state. Frankly, if you look around, they're all over\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the state and a lot\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of crime crimes at an all time high.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 You would think we'd do very well in New York. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 57:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it starts for New York. But it is it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 also you know, it's MSG. It's Madison Square Garden\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 If you like guys like you and I that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 means a lot those words Madison Square Garden, right?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Don't you think so? And Sid Rosenberg coming up\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 who's going to speak first. That's going to be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 great Yeah, we're gonna have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we're gonna have a good time I think we're gonna\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have a great time and it is in a certain\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 way. I didn't do it for that reason I did\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it because it's it's a very big\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 stop And you know, we sold\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it out in three hours It was totally sold out\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in three hours, which is pretty amazing when you think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of it for politics I don't have a guitar So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 when you can do it when you can do\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that in three hours without a guitar, that's pretty\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 good But there's a great feeling, you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know, we did great in 2016. We actually did\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 much better in 2020 as you know in terms\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of votes and uh this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 one will be uh That there's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 no comparison between the first two and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this one the level of enthusiasm I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think you see it too. The level\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of enthusiasm for this is Greater\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 than anything i've ever done. Uh, take a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 58:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 look at mcdonald's. I went into a mcdonald's.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 It's become this Incredible\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 story Google said\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's one of the most searched things\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they've ever had. It's it's pretty\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wild So it's all about the level of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 enthusiasm. We've never had anything like this one,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 uh, doug emhoff I'm sure you didn't have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a chance to see this or maybe you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 did they're running out so many ads He's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 got an ad out with ben stiller and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 andy cohen Talking about the need to be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a girl dad and stand up for abortion\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 rights with the scandals of rumors swirling around\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 him Should he be telling us how to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 be a girl dad? No,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I don't think so. I think it's that good.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think that uh, I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think the whole group is not so good This\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is not what our country needs. I hope that we're going\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to have the The kind of results\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that we're seeing in early voting, you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know, the early voting has been Extraordinary\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 so far I would say beyond\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 our wildest expectation if you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 look at north carolina you look at george I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 guess somebody one of the I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 59:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think the atlanta paper came out with about\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a five, four or five point\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 spread already that we're leading. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we're doing, we seem to be doing very well\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in early voting, but who knows? We have to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 get it. You have to get it over the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 top. There's great enthusiasm. We've never had, Hey, look,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's my third time doing this. We've never,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we did an incredible in 16. We\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 did better in terms of voting by millions of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 votes. The second we've never had\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 enthusiasm like now. And part of the reason\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is because they've been so bad. What?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 In other words, they've been so bad. What, you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know, you love competition. You like to break down\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the numbers out of the seven battleground States. What\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 worries you the most? Cheating.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Which one though, which state? No,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 all of them. I mean, did they cheat all\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of them? I mean, the biggest risk\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to me, I think we went it easily. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think I would have just campaigned at, at\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 30% of what I've done. You\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know, I haven't taken a day off in 52\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 days and now I have 13 and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 she's sleeping today and she'll sleep. I hear tomorrow\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:00:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 too. She's going to sleep all day. She's like\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Biden, so I just sleep a lot. Well, no,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I haven't taken, I haven't taken days. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have not taken days off at\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 all. Nor should I. You know,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this is the big thing. This is going to be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 make America great again. We can't take a chance. Our\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 country, if we don't win this race,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 our country's in serious jeopardy. Well, one\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sports question, but before I do that,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this quote from Barack Obama, he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wants you to believe, meaning to Trump. If you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 elect him, he will round up whoever he wants,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 ship them out and all our problems will be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 gone. When I hear Donald Trump talk, he's very\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 quick to say, Kamala, you're the vice president. You\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 had it for four years. He said,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 dude, you were the president for four years. Why\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 haven't you done it? What's your response to Obama?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Well, I did do it. We had the strongest\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 border in history. I built hundreds of miles of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wall. I did do it. If\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you look at that famous chart, that now very\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 famous chart, the lowest point that we've had for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 virtually. So why does he say this? What's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the last day? Why is it? What\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 kind of attack plan is that then? Do you think like, you know,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:01:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do you notice when he's a. attacking you? I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 don't care what he says. Look, I mean, the guy, I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 thought he was a very divisive president, not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a good president. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 look at it. Look at the kind of things.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Look at the mistakes they made when he was\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 president. He was, frankly, compared to Biden, he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was good. Compared to this group, he was good.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 But he was a very divisive president, not a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 good president at all. But when they say, why\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 didn't Trump do it? I did do it. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 built hundreds of miles of wall. I was going\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to build 200 more that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 were all set to be put in place. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 these people didn't do it. And we had\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the best border in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 history. And for him to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 say that is just pretty amazing. But that's all\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm saying. Nobody. Here's the good\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 news about Obama. Nobody listens to him.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 When the vice president is campaigning, she's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 doing town halls with Liz Cheney. She's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 trying to get disinfected, I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 guess disenfranchised Republicans. Why\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do you think she's doing these town halls\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 with Liz Cheney? Liz Cheney had the biggest\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:02:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 loss in the history of the United States\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Congress, losing by almost 40\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 points. Think of it. The biggest loss,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 because most people when they're down that much,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 if they're in Congress, what they do is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they resign before going through a humiliation like\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that. She is so bad. She was a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 war hawk like her father, a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 war hawk. He was the one that pushed\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Bush into the Middle East and spent\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 $10 trillion. I mean, think of it.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 $10 trillion that we got. We\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 got nothing but death. Everybody\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 got death out of it. Loss and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 death. And Liz Cheney,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's very interesting because here you have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 somebody that went into the Middle East and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 she's trying to get, this is the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 man who wanted to get strongly, wanted\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to get into the Middle East\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and kill the Arabs. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 she's trying to get Arab supporters. She's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 got Liz Cheney of all people.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And Liz Cheney was a war hawk. That's why I never\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 got along with her. She wanted to go to Woolworth, everybody.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Big brave Liz Cheney. Let's kill\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a lot of people. It's graceful. We know\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:03:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that. I think it's a huge negative for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 her, by the way, for Kamala,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 as the expression goes. Why\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do you think she's not campaigning at all with\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 President Biden? And what do you think that ...\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 What message is that? Well I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think she's not campaigning at all. She's off today, and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 she's off tomorrow or the next day. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I've gone 52 days in a row, and we have 13 left, and I won't be taking\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 off. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 will not be taking off. But think of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it. She's off today, and she's going to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 be off tomorrow. David, this is not what\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we want for a president. So when I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 used to cover sports, they used to say,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 yeah, Donald Trump's up there with George Steinbrenner,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 as usual. You guys used to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 go on the Yankee Hey Day, the good and bad\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 days. You sit there and watch George Steinbrenner erupt or\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 cheer. Very consequential guy. Now your\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mutual friend, Randy Levine, is running things. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 try to get some inside information about the World\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Series. First one in New York since 2009. First\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 time they met since 1981. Donald\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump, your prediction on the World Series seen\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:04:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on Fox, game one, game two, will be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 out in Los Angeles. Your thoughts about how\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 long it goes and who's going to win?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Well I'm going to say the Yankees. You know, Randy is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a great friend of mine. George and the family, his\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 family is made of a lot of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 terrific people. And so\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I have to go with the Yankees, of course. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we'll see what happens. The Dodgers have a great team.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 You know, they have a great team. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 if the Yankees are hot with their bats,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I would say they have maybe a little bit of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 an advantage. What are the odds on it, by the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 way? Who's favorite to win? Similar?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 That's a great question. I'm not a big betting guy.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I would think the Dodgers might be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 favorite with a better record overall. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the Yankees really coasted through the playoffs and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 judges beginning to hit. Dodgers are\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 favored, minus 130. All right,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we're not betting people, are we? You don't bet, do you?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 We don't want to bet. But I'll say the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Yankees will win. You and I will\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 talk about it after. Will you go to a game? Hopefully\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:05:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they'll have a good. You\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know the problem is because of the security of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the stuff. I don't want to make it uncomfortable\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 for everyone else. Yeah All right, mr. President. I'd\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 love to well We\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are our audience really appreciates the time especially\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you're in Omaha You're being heard in Omaha\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 now, and there's a electoral votes just\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 waiting there so\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:18\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Omaha, and I really hope you're gonna give\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 me that vote because I would\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 go out there right now and Whether\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's gonna be that important or not it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 may be under it, you know certain limited\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Under a limited circumstance. It could be a very\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 important vote, but I do great in Nebraska I'd\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 love to get that Omaha vote. You know, it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a little bit segmented from the rest. I understand\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 You know and we should have done they had\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a rogue They had a little bit of a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 rogue senator out there decided that he wanted to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 get a little free publicity So he didn't get\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that done, but that's okay I would love to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:54\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:06:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to me Thank you. Yes, and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you could vote early and set an example if you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 want it to in Florida, that would be an interesting\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 decision Well, you know, it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 interesting. I really feel I'm very mixed.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 You know, I have the old standard\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of The Tuesday vote\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and all a lot of people like to vote and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm really mixed You know, the main thing to me\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is you got to vote you got a vote a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 voting early I guess would be good, but you know\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 people have Different feelings about it.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 But the main thing is you got to get out\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you got a vote and I'll\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 be voting early That's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 interesting great and we'll see if Elon Musk\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is doing that too. He's Is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he's a great as he's right now\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 campaigning in Pennsylvania while she's sleeping. She's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sleeping and Elon is campaigning Elon\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is busier than her to believe\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he's half Henry Ford half Edison\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and and half Benjamin Franklin Whatever\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he's unbelievable. He's unbelievable even even\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the Starlink. He got it for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 notes. Think of it He got it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:07:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 for North Carolina Starlink where they had no\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 communications. People were dying over\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 no communication. And he got\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it to them right away at my request. He's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 amazing, that guy. So well, it's nice\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to have him on my side, Brian.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Do you agree? I agree. He's got\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 good cars and good spacecraft, and he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 doesn't waste anything. They land intact. Right.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 They land. I've never seen anything\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 like it. It's really something. Thanks\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a lot. Best of luck Sunday and best of luck\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in North Carolina. Those people need a lot of help.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 luck. Thanks for doing a great job.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 host, educating,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 entertaining, enlightening. You're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:08:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 with Brian Kilmeade.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 The fastest three hours in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 radio. You're with Brian Kilmeade.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Nice of the president to sit down, give me some\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 quality time yesterday in the afternoon. And I have to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 say, I had a chance to talk to him, as\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I said before, as dating\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 back to 88 when I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was doing sports phone,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 graduating college. And, you know,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 when he's upbeat, he was upbeat pretty much every minute\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 until he became a politician. But sometimes he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 hops on and he's hopped on with us here on the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 show live. And hi. Hi. Brought\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 kind of angry. All right. Yesterday,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 when I when I call, when he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 called in and we we patched me in, he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 said, hello, we have a small talk\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and I was trying to say, well, this is not on\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 because I know I just want to see what you think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and how you think it's going. He really\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 feels good about his prospects. He feels like things\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are going. But then a few hours later, how\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 come this story in the Atlantic about\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:09:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 what General General. Kelly says he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 said about German generals in Hitler\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and gold\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 star families. Here we go\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 again, and I predicted it. There'll be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 some type of pushback from these generals that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 work for him. Admiral McRaven\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 didn't, Admiral McRaven didn't like\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 him. General\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Kelly didn't like him. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we also have General Madison\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 like him. But the people\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that replaced him did really well. I mean,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Robert O'Brien was fantastic. National Security Advisor McMaster\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 liked a lot of what he didn't and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 didn't, but he did a great job. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 then John Bolton took over. He was later replaced.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 John Bolton was\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a bad mix for the president. I like\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 John Bolton. He's been a great friend of the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 show, but for him to think that Kamala Harris\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would be better for the country than Donald\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump is nuts. Kamala\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Harris is a disaster. She stands\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 for nothing. She's done nothing. Accomplished\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:10:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 nothing. Worst vice president ever. The\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 most maligned certainly since Dan Quill.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Although to Dan Quill, their indications, it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was unjustly. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I thought he was upbeat. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I thought he was pretty strong yesterday. We'll\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 see where we're going. And we did find out that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he's voting early. And I know it's not the sexiest\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 topic in the world. You might not be talking about\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 your tailgate this weekend, but the whole brick story is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 32 nations formed to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 essentially be anti G\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 seven anti American to try to find\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 an economic force that would freeze us out. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we have some allies on that. And I asked\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 him about that and you heard his answer on\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it. If it ends up being the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 de-dollarization of the world, it is like a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 third world war. We'd have to restructure all\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 our debt and everything else. What's coming up\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Friday is Joe Rogan. So Rogan,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 who said, I'm not going to interview Trump\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 because I don't want to help him, has\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 changed his mind. Had a chance to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 meet him, talks to Dana White, who's one of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 his best friends and one of Joe Rogan's best\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:11:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 friends. They have mutual and getting to see our.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 everything's falling out and Elon must be in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 best friends with Rogan. He's not saying I'm\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 endorsing anybody, but what he's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 saying is come to the show for three\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 hours and you will see, just\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 like Andrew Shultz, that's outstanding comedian who has\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a podcast, you'll see the numbers even for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Joe Rogan go through the roof because they're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to want to see them interact. You\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have no idea what Rogan's going to bring\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 up, but the reason why Trump thrives in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this is the only things they'll bring up\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is personal things that might be shocking. Trump\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 doesn't care about personal stuff. If you want to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 talk about the color or this or that, you're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to bring up 1970s and some type of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 situation with his dad. He's not going to embrace\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it, but he'll\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 talk about everything. So that won't be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a problem. I think you'll see that side of them\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and maybe Joe Rogan without any notes will bring up\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 something nobody else has brought up yet that he's not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to read a book. He's maybe watch\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the news, but overall, you're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 looking at a race that Donald\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump is on the cost of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:12:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 winning. If the election was today, I think he'd win. Just\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 judge him by the momentum and judge him by the actions\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of the other guys. Inepness\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 for Kamala Harris to take off entirely yesterday.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 She doesn't need any more fundraisers, got\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 more money than anybody else ever used.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 You cannot spend all this money. Everybody\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 knows you got more money. But then\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to go to Texas tomorrow, really?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Why are you going to Texas? Well, I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 want to help out Colin Alred against Ted\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Cruz. Really? Why do you care about\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a race in which more than\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 likely the Democrats going to lose in a state that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you're not going to win? You\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 worry about your seven states. Go\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 visit hurricane victims in North Carolina. That's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 an idea. Go to Michigan and don't\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 just stay in Detroit. That's another idea.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 It's Brian Kilmeade. Welcome\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to the latest moment to the Brian Kilmeade show. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:13:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 glad you're here. Make sure. you call\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 1-866-408-7669. Martha\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 McCallum will be here at the bottom of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the hour. Mike Dunleavy, the 12th governor of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Alaska, he's been doing this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 since 2018, will be joining me shortly. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we have a lot to do. Special thanks\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to the former president for joining me at\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a previous hour, depending on when you're getting\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the show. And keep in mind, go to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 briankillmeetshow.com, and you can hear the entire interview unedited.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 So before we get to the governor of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Alaska, let's get to the big three. Now\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 with the stories you need to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know, it's Brian's Big Three. Number\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 three. Can you assure the Israelis this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was not an intentional leak by the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 administration? Well, first of all, Jen, you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know that I take handling of classified\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 information very, very seriously. We remain committed\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to supporting each other and being as\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 transparent as possible. And I'll leave it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 at that. Yes, if they only left\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it by President Biden's Corvette, no one\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would have ever found it. Leaked\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 satellite images on Telegram, while Pentagon says they\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 had no they have no suspects. And Defense\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:14:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Secretary Lloyd Austin didn't rule out the possibility\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of an intentional leak\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 by someone in his administration.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 This is Israel prepares to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 pay back Iran for their rocket attacks from\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a month ago. Number\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 two. You know, the main thing to me is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you got to vote. You got to vote. Voting\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 early, I guess, would be good. But, you know,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 people have different feelings about it. But the main\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 thing is you got to get out. You got\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to vote. And I'll be voting early. I'll be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 voting early. All right. That's pretty big\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 news. He told us he's voting early. A\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 lot of difference in four years ago when\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he said only can't count it on Election\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Day. There you go. I talked to President\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump for 30 minutes while President while Vice\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 President Harris seems to fall apart on NBC.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 She struggles to define and defend her programs,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 policies and her loyalty and health\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of President Biden. You'll hear the whole for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a Trump interview and listen to it. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we'll get some clips for it. Number\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 one, I think he's had some\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 very strong issues in swing states\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 doing the auto workers in Michigan,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 fracking in Pennsylvania and no\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:15:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 tax on tips in Nevada. I think it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 been a clever campaign in all those respects.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And so I think he's got\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the edge. That's Mark\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Penn, Democratic strategist, pollster, 13\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 days until election day for 2024. Early\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 returns show a surge in Republicans getting out\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to vote early under Trump, when it usually\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is he's a day of game guy. Dems\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 quietly start to panic about the polls, in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 my view. VP Harris has a light\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 schedule, which is an odd way to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 say I'm trailing. Meanwhile, Biden rages and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 hurts Harris in the process. Governor\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Mike Dunleavy joins us now. Governor, great to hear from\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you. It's great to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 be on, Brian. Thanks for having me. Now that you're in the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mainland, are you with us or in Alaska? No,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm in Alaska. Okay. It's about 7.08 AM.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Wow, I appreciate you getting up early. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Governor, where do you feel this race is? I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think reality is setting in. I was just listening\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to your last, your top three in your segments.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think reality is setting in that Harris\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:16:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is, you know, there's nothing there.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And that people are looking back four years\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and asking themselves are they better off today\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 than they were four years ago. And anyone that's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 honest is gonna say no. If you're a college\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 student, you're living with your parents, you can't afford\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to pay off your loans, you can't afford to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 buy a house. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mean, the list goes on and on and on. You look at the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wars in the Middle East, the Houthi slinging rockets at\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Israel, what's happening in Russia. None\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of this was happening under Trump. And I think people are starting\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to realize that actually those four\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 years were pretty good years. They shut down\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the Red Sea, causing people to go around\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Africa now. So this is absolutely incredible. Columbus\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 had it better. Kamala Harris sat\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 down with NBC, thought she'd have a walk in the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 park. The problem is she can't have a walk in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the park if she never wants to answer a legitimate\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 question. Listen to this, cut 12. Do\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you believe that transgender Americans should have access\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to gender-affirming care in this country? I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 believe we should follow the law. I mean,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think you're probably pointing to the fact\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that Donald Trump's campaign has spent tens of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:17:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 millions of dollars. They're trying to define you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on this. I'm asking you to define\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 yourself though. Just broadly speaking, what is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 your value? Do you believe they should\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have that access? I believe that people,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 as the law states, even on this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 issue about federal law, that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that is a decision that doctors will make in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 terms of what is medically necessary. I'm not gonna\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 put myself in the position of a doctor. Is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 she kidding? You don't have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 any opinions on transgender surgery? She\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 does, Brian, but she doesn't wanna state what they are. Exactly.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 That's the problem. And that's what people are saying. You don't\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have that problem with President Trump. He's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 running on it. I wanna talk about\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 energy. It matters so much to you. When people\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 come out, Governor Dunleavy, and say, well, energy production\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is up. I don't know what you're talking about\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 being a new Green Deal administration.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 What could you tell us is the reality as\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you see it in Alaska? Well,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Alaska, to be honest with you, has been\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 brutalized by this administration. Senator\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Dan Sullivan has a very interesting chart that shows\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 66 actions by\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this administration in the past four\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:18:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 years against Alaska, just Alaska only.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Everything from shutting down ANWR, which was opened up in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 2017, and a bill signed\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 by Congress, the offshore oil\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 leases, NPRA, National Petroleum Reserve, which is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a petroleum reserve. It was there for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 oil, 13 million acres taken off the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 table. The list goes on and on\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and on. And Alaska is a resource\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 state. We were producing 2 million barrels\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 per day in 1989. We're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 still producing about 500,000 barrels today. It's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a tremendous opportunity to drive down the cost\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of energy in the United States of America\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and help our Asian allies. But every\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 turn, every day, there seems to be a new\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 executive order favoring\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 talking to Venezuela to get oil, or\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Saudi Arabia as opposed to its own country. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 so we're really looking forward to this election\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 up here in Alaska. I could tell you, as the only\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 red state left on the West Coast, President\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump is gonna win up here in Alaska, and we'll do our\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 part to get him over the finish line. So let me get\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this straight. You're doing 500,000 barrels, and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:19:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you could be doing 2 million. We\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 were doing $200,000, we're doing $500,000 barrels now,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 but if they allowed us just to take\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 advantage of the opportunities that we have, we\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 estimate we'd be back up to $800,000 barrels,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 maybe $900,000 barrels. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 almost doubling what we have now if they\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 just allowed us to drill. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Anwar was part of the tax reform package. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we can't get a hold of the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 whole Biden, excuse the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Biden-Harris energy plan. Now the Harris\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 energy plan. We know where she\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 stood in 2020, but listen, dating back to 2019,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I want you to hear her all her different positions on\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 when it comes to oil and gas. Cut 34. There's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. So, yes. Do\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you still want to ban fracking? No,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and I made that clear on the debate\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 stage in 2020 that I would not ban\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 fracking. I made that very clear in 2020.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I will not ban fracking. I have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 not banned fracking as Vice President of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the United States. And in fact, I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:20:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Reduction Act, which opened new leases for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 fracking. So where do\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we believe? Then we have our\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 surrogates coming out yesterday saying\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they say you can keep\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 fracking but no new exploration.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 That is this Camilla Thorndike.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And then she walked it back saying, I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 didn't explain myself clearly. Contrary to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump's claims, the VP has not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 banned fracking and doesn't support banning fracking.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 In fact, she\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 cast the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Reduction Act about fracking. About\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 new leases, she goes,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we're open to new leases after saying they\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 weren't and currently we're in a pause. This\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is a big deal. Truly\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it is. You know, Brian, I'm originally from Scranton,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Pennsylvania. I'm the other guy that's from\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Scranton, Pennsylvania. I grew up heating\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 our house with coal, heating our hot water with\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 coal. Susquehanna County, which is just north\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of Scranton, is where fracking is really taking place.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I've got friends there. And they\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 don't believe her. They don't believe what she's saying. They\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:21:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 believe what she was saying years ago. ago in which\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you want the band fracking, but they don't\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 believe the new Kamala Harris today. And so\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 again, I'm optimistic that Pennsylvania is going to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do its part as well and making sure\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that we can put the last four years\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 behind us and really look at a future\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 for all Americans and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 our young people. But nobody believes her.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 That's why you see her poll numbers\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and her possibilities of winning the election falling.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Right. And I guess\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we're going to see what happens with the Republican Party.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Also with the Senate, you get a good\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 indication of where the election's going because\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you look at the Senate, it looks like\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 McCormick is closing. Hovde is closing in Wisconsin.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 McCormick is closing in Pennsylvania.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And you have Bernie Moreno who's come out of nowhere.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 He's now with one point of Sherrod Brown, who's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a long term senator there in Ohio. Do\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you look at that? Tim Sheehy's up five,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it looks like, in Montana. It\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 looks like that'll flip. Does that indicate\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to you that something's happened at the presidential level?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:22:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Yeah, I think so. I think you're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to see a number of Senate\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 races turn for the Republicans. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think we're going to get one. We're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to get several to have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a cushion in the Senate. I'm also\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 optimistic on the House. I know that some people are\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 questioning that, but I'm optimistic on the House. Up here\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we have one seat that used to belong to Don\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Young for 49 years. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we're optimistic that we can get that back\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to a Republican seat. Right\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 now we're holding our breath up here. We're doing our\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 part. But I think you're going\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to see Republicans in charge because, again, you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 just have to look at the last four\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 years, Brian. Are you better off the last\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 four years than you were before with President\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump? And the answer is clearly no. Whether\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you're an internationalist looking at what's happening across\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the globe, whether you're interested in energy, or\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 whether you're just a senior going to the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 store to try and buy food, it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:23:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 worse today than it was four years ago. He\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is still optimistic about Harris's chances.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Listen to how he describes her schedule. Cut 10. The\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 vice president and the entire team of us have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 been traveling to every swing state, I mean ad\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 nauseam. I mean if you go look at\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the schedule, the vice president was in three states\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 yesterday, not just one, and then\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 weeks before that have been aggressively going to all\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of the swing states. The point\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is that there is an issue that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is bigger than whatever minor differences we\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 may have about some policy agreements, and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that is the protection of democracy. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think that when you can say that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you've got Bernie Sanders and Liz Cheney\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and Dick Cheney and 25 of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the people that worked with Donald Trump all\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 saying that, hey, he shouldn't be anywhere near\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the Oval Office, I think when you highlight\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that, I think it makes a big difference.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 What's your reaction? You\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know, I've heard this for years, and to me\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's just nonsense. President Trump, there\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was no coup. There was no National Guard\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 called in, Army called in. It's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 fear-mongering at its worst, and it's a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:24:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 rejection of reality in history. It just\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 never happened, and it won't happen. That's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the only thing they hope they\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 can leverage, is that fiction. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 long story short, people see right\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 through it. People again,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 when they go to the store, when they fill up\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 their gas tank, when they try and buy a house,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 when they're trying to pay off their student loans, they're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 thinking about those bread and butter issues,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and those are the real issues that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 almost all Americans are thinking about. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 what about Russia and the constant breaches\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of your borders and our air and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 international airspace? Are you seeing\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that? We're watching North Korea is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 now sending troops into Ukraine\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to fight with Russia, China doing\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 military exercises to blockade Taiwan.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 We hear about Russia breaching our\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 airspace. What are you seeing\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:25:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 up in Alaska, Governor Dunleavy? between\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 two islands, one owned by the United States and one\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 owned by Russia. Very, very close. We\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have flyovers constantly, and it's increased. Part of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the reason, the theory behind that is that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 if Russia believes that America is weak, which\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 if you look at the Middle East and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 what's happening around the world, it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 not difficult for some to perceive that,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they're going to test our defenses. We\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have the Chinese that claim that they're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 near Arctic Nation. They have four going\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on five icebreakers. America's got\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 two up here in Alaska. One\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is not even working. And so they look at\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this and they say to themselves, maybe this is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 an opportunity to flex our muscles. We\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 also have the Koreans running the North\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Korean missile umbrella. We\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have interceptors here in Alaska.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Don't get me wrong, we have a very\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 strong military up here. We're used to being\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and playing in this dangerous backyard as the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 main sport for North America. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 when you have an administration in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Washington that exudes weakness across\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:26:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the globe, you're going to have these\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 outfits try and probe our defenses. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 again, I think if they had\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 an opportunity to vote, they'd probably vote for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Vice President Harris because they know that once\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 President Trump gets in, it's going to be\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a different ballgame. Right. She's from a middle\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 class family that could be intimidating. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 according to Putin, she has an infectious laugh.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 So he's having a great time with this matchup.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Governor Mike Dunleavy, thanks so much. Hey,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 thanks for having me, Brian. The\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 talk show that's getting you talking.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 You're with Brian Kilmeade. I think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Donald Trump has an edge. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would not count Kamala Harris out\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:27:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 at this point, but I think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 He's got an edge because he's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 winning on all the major issues.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think he's had some very\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 strong issues in swing states doing\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the auto workers in Michigan, fracking\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in Pennsylvania, and no\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 tax on tips in Nevada. I think it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 been a clever campaign in all those respects.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And so I think he's got\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the edge. That is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Mark Penn, Democratic strategist. I just wanted to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 play that for Martha McCallum to get us\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 off talking about this election. One point of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 view, Martha, everyone's got one. We're subjected to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the pollsters that let us know what's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going on and people that tell us what's happening when\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we're not out on the trail ourselves. Martha, your reaction\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to a Mark Penn just said, great to see you.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 You know, hi, Brian. It's great to be with you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 as always. Now we are inside of two weeks out.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 It's a super exciting time to be covering all of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this. Every morning I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 seem to wake up to something that has popped\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 into my inbox that explains how the polls are\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 different this time. They're doing more text messaging. They're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 doing different kinds of outreach. They're panicked because they\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:28:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 don't know if they're right or wrong and they\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 could have gotten it wrong again this time. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we'll see what happens on election night. But I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 always like listening to Mark Penn. I think he's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a very straight shooter. He worked\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 for Hillary Clinton's campaign. He's a longtime\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Democratic operative. And yet I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think he sees things very\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 clearly and in an unbiased way. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I appreciate his take. And I think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he's right. I think that, you know,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 people can easily identify several issues that they\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know Trump feels very strongly about it. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he said it yesterday at this Hispanic roundtable\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 event that he did where he\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 said, look, everyone knows where I stand. I stood in the same place\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 for the last 20 years. America first.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm at national security. These are my issues. You know,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 everyone knows where I stand. And then I look\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 at the, you know, Hallie Jackson interview and I see\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Harris meandering. And I think a lot of people\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have a big question mark on their head still about\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 where she stands. I want you to hear what Maria\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Shriver said yesterday. You're not.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Unfortunately, we have some pre determined questions and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I hopefully I'll be able to ask some\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of the questions that might be in your\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 head. I hope so. So they're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:29:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 doing a they're doing a town hall. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 if someone said, can I ask a question? And she says,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you're not. You know, because I have pre\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we have predetermined questions. Now Mark\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Penn said we were able to have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a successful Senate run as Hillary Clinton.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 We wanted a listening tour. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would never have allowed that. Why\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would you have a town hall and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 let Maria Shriver have pre-existing can it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 not a town hall. Just say you want to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do an interview with Maria Shriver. Yeah. I mean,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I sort of bemoan that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the town hall environment has become very\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 structured. And I think that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a lot of, I think that it would\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 be good to get back to a format where\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 there is a little bit more free reign. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 always think of that moment with John McCain at\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the town hall where the woman stood up and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 said something derogatory about President Obama who he was\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 running against. And he said, no ma'am, that's not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 true. And those kinds of organic moments, we don't\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 see all that much in these\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 environments anymore. But yeah, that doesn't, that's not a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 good look at all. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I mean, Hallie Jackson, and we'll play some of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:30:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that after you're back from the break, very\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 similar to Brad Bear. She just\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 had follow up questions. Absolutely. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they're not hard questions. I like to break down your\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 healthcare plan. To tell you the truth in the debate,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Trump hasn't talked about healthcare in three, four years. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 expect that was a bit of a, all right, it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 important, but I have the framework of a plan. Got\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 me. She wasn't looking for a gotcha.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 She's looking for an explain. Just\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 explain. This is an opportunity. If you're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in controversy, give you an opportunity to talk. I'll\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have a follow up question and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 she can't do it. And I'm just wondering, what are\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they, what are they doing? I mean, she's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a smart, smart woman, law degree. You\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know what I think it's a classic\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 case of, you know, being over managed\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 or maybe she's over managing herself and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 she really is so reluctant to stake\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 out ground and say, this is where\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I stand. You know, for instance, the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 transgender question that she was asked, it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 been a successful advertising campaign with\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that sound bite of her a couple\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of years back saying that she\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:31:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 thinks that transgender operations. prisoners\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 with taxpayer money is a good idea. You know,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 lay down the law, tell us what you think, it hasn't happened.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 You should be making concessions when we're talking\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 your own body. To Republicans like, for example,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, who would back something\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 like this on a Democratic agenda if, in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 fact, Republicans control Congress, would you offer them\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 an olive branch? Or is that off the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 table? Is that not an option for you?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals because\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we can go on with a variety of scenarios.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Let's just start with a fundamental fact. A\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 basic freedom has been taken from the women\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of America, the freedom to make\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:32:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 decisions about their own body. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that cannot be negotiable, which\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is that we need to put back\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in the protections of Roe v. Wade.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And that is it. But what if you can't do that?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 What if you can't get that passed and you want to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 save lives in Florida and in Texas and in Georgia? What\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do you do? I'm not going to go down that rabbit\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 hole with you right now. It's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 not a rabbit hole, really. I mean, it's something that really\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 could happen. You're not going to put Roe v. Wade back.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Does anyone think the Senate is not going to Republicans? So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I mean, come on. What are you talking about? No, you have to be realistic and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you have to have some sense of what your plan is. Martha\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Callum here, by the way, as she starts at 3 o'clock.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Hi, guys. Great to be with you, Brian. Thank\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you. You have to be realistic about what your\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 plan is. And you have to say ... The\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 fact of the matter is, and I feel like\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this has never been clearly articulated by Republicans. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I know President Trump has tried to say, it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 goes back to the states now, right? It goes\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 back to the states. So people closer to those\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 decisions, it's a classic states' right argument. They're the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 ones who get to make those decisions about what\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:33:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the laws are in their own state. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this whole thing about, you know, women's bodies\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and allowing them to make their own decision,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I just always go back to the little\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 girl inside those bodies sometimes. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I wonder when these same, I would love\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to ask Vice President Harris, so\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 at what point does the baby girl's rights\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 start to matter? Love\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it. I love it. How\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 about this? When can you hear the heartbeat? Six\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 weeks. So six weeks.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 When can you say, you can hear a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 baby's heartbeat is six weeks. When\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do you consider that baby\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a human being that should be allowed to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 be born? What\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would she say to that? I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mean, I would love to hear the answer to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that question. But you know what, she would, here's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 my guess based on, you know, just watching her\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a lot as we all have, is that she\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would say, that's between the woman and her doctor.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 That's between the woman and her doctor. Now for me to decide,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's between the woman and her doctor. You're a woman. When\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:34:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do you think you're a person? You're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 an American. When do you think?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think she would squirtle around. I think she would\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 say, look, you know, I am here to uphold the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 law. This is my role as\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 president of the United States. And I respect\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the decisions of the court. What\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 about religious exemptions? So it's a, am\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I to understand this? If I, unless I have it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wrong, when she's saying no religious\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 exemptions, so if you're a Catholic hospital, you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have to do abortions. That's not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to work. You know,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we've been down this road before. Remember the little\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sisters of the poor case? You\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 cannot make a religious organization\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 provide a benefit that goes against their\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 faith. And she always says on this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 issue, Brian, we, you know, you can\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 still have your deeply held beliefs. I'd\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 love to know what her deeply held\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 beliefs are. Still don't know any. On\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this issue, we still don't know. You\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know, and I just think that even if she\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 were to say, you know, look,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you have to be, you know, even Europe has a 16\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:35:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 week. cut off. I mean there\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are many people who believe that that is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a barbaric move at that level at that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 time marker. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 yeah, she just she's gonna bob and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 weave on it like she has. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'd love to know her religious. She's not stepping\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on anyone's deeply held religious beliefs and she's gonna\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have to respect that Catholic hospital. So those things\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have to line up. So I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 want you to hear what she said about another\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 issue that she really doesn't weigh in on much\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Haley Jackson. Halle Jackson should be giving\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 credit for this. But we still don't have an answer. Cut\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 12. Do you believe that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 transgender Americans should have access to gender affirming\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 care in this country? I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 believe we should follow the law. I mean,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think you're probably pointing to the fact\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that Donald Trump's campaign has spent tens of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 millions of dollars. They're trying to define you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on this. I'm asking you to define yourself\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 though. Just broadly speaking, what is your value?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Do you believe they should have that access?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I believe that that people as the law\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 states, even on this issue about federal law,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that it is a decision that doctors will make\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:36:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in terms of what is medically necessary. I'm not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 gonna put myself in the position of a doctor. Frankly,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that story. I thought it was very interesting. It's an emergency. I gotta\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 be a woman. Yeah, exactly.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 That Halle Jackson said, define your value\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on that because she's putting her own\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 words back on her where she said,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 my values haven't changed. Right?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 So what is your value? She's asking her\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on this issue. Now, my only quibble with\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the way that it was phrased is that,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you know, and she talks about the millions\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of dollars that Trump is spending on this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 ad, but the ad shows her words. It's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a full sound by question. And then the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 answer about transgender's rights to have gender\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 changing surgery as prisoners\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in the just in our, you know, penal system\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 with taxpayer dollars. So I would love to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 hear her answer to that. Do you stand\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 by what you said in that ad that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you're complaining about? Do you still believe that?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Another issue on this whole big subject\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is should parents be able to block\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 their child who's under the age of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:37:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 18 from making this life changing decision?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And I would love to hear her answer on\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that as well. It was a broad question, and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think she was looking for her to reaffirm,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 thinking for the LGBTQ community, but the two\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 issues are either, you know, prisoners and taxpayer\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 dollars or kids under 18. Where\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do you think Trump's answer to that is? So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that's a very good question. I mean,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think on the under 18 thing,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he's clear. He would not\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 allow a child. You know, when you are\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 under your parents' care, 18 years\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 old, you know, we've seen so many kids\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 say that this was a big mistake. The\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 parents get backed into these things by these,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm sorry, but you know, crazy doctors, it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 my opinion, who are telling them that if\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you don't do this, your child's going to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 commit suicide. I mean, can you imagine as\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a parent, a doctor saying that to you? You\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 better do this or your child's going\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to kill them. I mean, it is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 so heartbreaking to me. I feel confident\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:38:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that President Trump would be on\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the side of, you know, allowing a parent to make\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that decision. And in terms of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in the just in the penal system for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 prisoners, I think, you know, he's going to suggest\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they better wait and find private funding for that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 surgery after they get out. No way. Yeah,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'd say no. I resound you know, on both and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 especially didn't get to the point in sports. Sports\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a big deal. Where they find out 60\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 different medals and placements were taken by transgender\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 men, dropping women from placing\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 or winning tournaments, trophies\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 or titles. A little\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 bit more because Kamala Harris didn't do\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 anything yesterday about Joe\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Biden. We still don't know why. Technically, we\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 still don't know why Joe Biden\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is not the nominee. Remember, he was only\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 off two or three points after that horrendous\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 debate where he froze and looked like a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mannequin. Cut 14. And you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 closed doors with him. It was\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a bad debate. People have bad debates. So\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that he is absolutely. That's the reason\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 why you're here and he's not running\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:39:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 for it. the top of the ticket. Well,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you'd have to ask him if that's the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 only reason why. What do you think? I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 am running for president of the United States. Joe Biden\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is not. And my presidency\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 will be about bringing\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a new generation\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of leadership to America that is focused\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on the work that we need to do to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 invest in the ambitions and aspirations of the American\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 people. So that's the boilerplate right\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 at the end there that you hear in pretty much\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 every answer that she gives. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sympathize with her answer on this. This is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a rock and a I don't know what\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the right answer to this question is either\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in her position, if she never saw anything,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 did she ever see, you know, that that's a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 weird answer, right? I never saw any of this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 behavior because I never spent time with\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 him. Right. No, of course we did think about\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 all the times he was wandering around the stage\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 looking for someone's hand to shake, falling going up\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the stairs of Air Force One. I mean, all\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of these examples, but she I, I, there is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:40:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 no good answer to this question because the only\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 other route she could have taken was to go\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to Jill Biden and say, we need to talk.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 There's a problem here. We got to work this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 out or go to the cabinet and say, I've\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 seen too much of this 25th amendment. We need\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to have a serious conversation about this for the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 good of the country, if that was her option\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 or to go directly to him and say, Mr.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 President, you're slipping, you're slipping and we need\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to talk about it. There's no evidence at all.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And I think that if she loses this race,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we're going to hear some, a lot of stories\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that are, give more detail to all of this.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 But I just think there's no good answer for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 her at this moment to that question. Well, I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mean, is it unbelievable that Nancy Pelosi, George Clooney, Barack\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:36\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Obama, all directly responsible would technically have no answer. What\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do you think she should have done? What do you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think she should have done? What I would have, what\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I have said is Joe Biden called me up and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 says, I'm not going to run again. We're behind the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 scenes. Everybody has good days and bad days. I'm sure\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 there's days that you could come up to me and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 say, wow, you forgot, she forgot Michigan yesterday when it\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 came to battleground states. But I would\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 absolutely say that President Biden\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:41:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 did not think he could do a second term. as\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he was coming to the end of his first term, he didn't think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he'd do the end of a second term. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I said, but then she's saying more than he's ever\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 said. And remember,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he handpicked her, but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he backed her, but by this time,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Martha, I need an answer. And like\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you said, go meet with Jill. Guys,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I can't remember. Sure. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wouldn't have done anything different. Takes two\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 days off, comes back and said, my\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 administration will not be a second Biden\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 administration term. So that should have been\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 July. That should have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 been July. But you know what they think they're slow to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 realize? And he gave her the leeway for that. He\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 said, she's going to carve her own path. That was\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 his way of saying, go ahead, go ahead. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you know what they didn't realize?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Because they're in a bubble. They didn't\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 realize how unpopular their administration\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was and the policies and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the arrogance in which they implemented their\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 policies. They said, everyone's happy about the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 new green deal. Everyone's happy about the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 chips act. Everyone's happy about the infrastructure.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Everyone's happy about the recovery pack. They're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:42:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 going to love it when I mandated\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 those vaccines and I demanded you were\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 massed and I looked out for your\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 safety by keeping schools closed. Really?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Okay. And you made me give money to Black Lives\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Matter. It wasted $90 million. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you told me where you were raised this country. Okay. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you told me that Georgia law was Jim\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Crow 2.0. I didn't really much.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Okay. They love me. All right. My approved\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 range 43%. Oh, the way you left\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Afghanistan, the what happened in Ukraine, what's going on\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 with Israel? You are the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 uproar on these campuses. It's a big deal.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm just doing my job. Time for one\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 three election. And then she realizes not only\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do I have to separate myself, if\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I don't, I'm going to lose.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I can't talk about any of these programs.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 The other inherent problem there is that the, you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know, Biden ran as a moderate, but then got\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 pulled to the left on all the things that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you just mentioned. She was already, she was already\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on the left. So now if she tries to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:52\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 go back to the middle, it's too late at\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:54\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this point, it tries to go\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 back to being a moderate candidate. She's, it's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:43:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 not going to be. believable at\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this point. So and I all the things that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you mentioned are half of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 America saying that they think this is too liberal\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's not the direction that they want to go\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in but Brian you know I don't know if\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 these polls are accurate none of us will know\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 until we get past the next two weeks but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 half of the country disagrees with you on those\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 things according to the polls. You\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mean that they're like their administration. I'm\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 just saying half of it you know it's a very\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it's a razor-thin margin from what we're seeing right\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 now if that's not true and if somebody wins\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 in a landslide well then we'll have a different\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 conversation but at least at this moment\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and I don't know yeah at least half the country\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 feels that way. But if she if that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is correct she'd say I am so\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 proud of the EV mandate\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I am so proud to push\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 for the new green deal I'm so\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 proud to subsidize. Maybe she should be saying\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 all those things for her side maybe she\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would be doing better if she\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was owning this space that they were in because\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 right now she's all over the place talking about\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:44:59\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 your hopes and aspirations and people don't have anything\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to grab onto like who are you what is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 it what do I where am I getting here.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm so proud to bring eight million illegals\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 many of which I know nothing about here\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm so proud of it I'm so proud\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to undo those dozens of Trump\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 era crackdowns on illegal immigrants\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 at the border I'm so proud that that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 fence is rusting in the desert rather than\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 standing up blocking in Paris. No I mean\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that's not you know if you were coaching\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 her and you would say you know you need\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to embrace the future of America immigration you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know you they're showing you all the ugly things\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 there are a few ugly things and we're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 gonna fix those holes but you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know there's an overwhelmingly good impact of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 having more people come into the country.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I mean these aren't my thoughts I'm\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:44\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 just saying if you're it's more specific\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 right you've got to own something. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 if I say what you just said at least I'm in a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 fact-based world I'm acknowledging there are eight\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 million people here and I'm saying it's great but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 don't just acknowledge they're not here and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:45:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 say that I've tried I've prosecuted transnational\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 gangs in 2012. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 know. I mean, think about those people.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I always go, my mind goes back to Chicago, to\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the city council meeting when all of those residents of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Chicago stood up, many of them black, many of them\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Hispanic, some of them white, and said like, why are\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 these people eating up all of our services? Why\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are they sleeping in our schools? Why\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 can my kids can't go play on the field\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they usually play on? And my mind just goes\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 back to them all the time. I think this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:25\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is people's reality. This is what they're\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 living every day. You cannot tell them\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:29\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that it's not happening, and that's why\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 she's in a box. When\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we come back more with Martha McKeown, we'll\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 find out what's on her show and then\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:38\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 ask her how she feels about General Kelly,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:40\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 General Mattis, and General Milley coming out and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:42\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 saying Trump likes Hitler. Giving\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you everything you need to know.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:48\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 You're with Brian Kilmeade. When\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:46:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you want truth you demand.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 This is the Brian Kilmeade Show.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 He promised him more than once that, you know, that Hitler\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 did some good things too, and of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 course, if you know history, again, I think he's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 lacking in that. But if you know what his,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you know, Hitler was all about, you'd be pretty\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 hard to make an argument that she\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 did anything good. Well,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 would you say that it was very hard, would you\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 say, Anderson? If\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you know history, if you know\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 history, it's hard to imagine Hitler did anything good.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:31\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 So obviously, I feel the same way. General\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:33\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Kelly talking about conversations he had behind the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:35\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 scenes with President Trump, and he felt compelled\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 to tell the Atlantic Magazine that Martha McAlmier,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 your show starts at three. Imagine\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you're going to discuss some of this\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and your thoughts about Kelly coming forward\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:46\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 now. Well,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:49\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm sure he has\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 his reasons. I think that President Trump would\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 say, well, I fired all those guys, and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that's why they're doing this. They\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:47:57\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have bruised egos. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 now they want to drudge up things that we said,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 you know, that were said in\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sort of in the office while\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:06\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 we were discussing things. So I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:08\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think it's unfortunate, honestly. I think it's a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:10\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 little unseemly at this stage of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:12\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the game. But\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I'm sure they have their reasons\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:17\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and they have freedom of speech.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:19\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 So you know, I mean, I think most people honestly,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:21\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I don't think they're going to change a single person's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:23\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mind with this issue. I think that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:26\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 President Trump is a very\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:28\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 unique man, a\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 unique operator. He says things and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 does things in a way that\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 are uniquely him. I think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 he has to be judged by his actions\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 rather than these comments in a lot of\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 ways. I think that the person who said,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 and I can't remember who said it originally,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 but you have to take him seriously, but\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 not literally, is the approach\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:50\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that people need to take with him for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 whatever they decide is their ballgame.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:56\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 But he's a unique, historic figure. There's\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:48:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 no doubt about it. This\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:01\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is what Trump's people said back. Trump\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:03\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 said this in a private conversation. Trump\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:05\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 said in a private conversation in the White House,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 according to two people who heard him say this,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 people who were totally loyal to him that follow\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 orders. This is absolutely false. Pfeiffer\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:14\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 wrote in an email, President Trump never said\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:16\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 this. So the quote\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 was, you know, so I have\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a few things to say. Number one, do I want\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 everything I say in a private conversation public? I don't\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 think anybody listening to me does. Number two,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:27\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 every time you bring up Hitler, just know what's next is bad.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:30\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 Number three is General Kelly and\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:32\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 General Mattis are playing politics. They swore they'd never\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:34\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 do it. That's why they got out of it.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:37\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 If they didn't like him and they didn't,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:39\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 they should have gotten out early. Instead they\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:41\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 sat there and undermined him. They thought for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:43\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 the good of the country, which to me\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:45\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 is pretty arrogant because the country voted the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:47\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 other guy in, not you. I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:51\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 mean, I think that General Mattis,\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:53\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 as you said, has stayed quiet for\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:55\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 a very long time. And\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:49:58\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 I think that history. is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:50:00\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 on the side of those who\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:50:02\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 don't insert themselves in these kinds\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:50:04\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 of moments. But honestly, I think\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:50:07\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 that, you know. Doesn't matter. Yeah, I\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:50:09\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 just think these guys feel like they're doing the\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:50:11\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 right thing, but you can see that Trump is\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:50:13\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 vehemently disagreeing and saying that these are people who\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:50:15\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 have bruised egos, and that's why they're lashing out.\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:50:18\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 And as you see from that comment, they say it was never\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:50:20\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 said. Is this the October surprise?\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:50:22\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 We'll find out. Watch the real story today\cb1 \

\f0\b \cb3 1:50:24\cb1 \

\f1\b0 \cb3 at 3 p.m. Eastern Time. Thanks, Brian.\cb1 \
