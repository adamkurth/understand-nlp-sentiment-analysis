\cf2 \cb3 There's so much to do, I mean to your point, being in the Senate, so there is a way of responsibility that I know we all feel right when we have been blessed with an experience that allows us to be a role model and to hopefully inspire people and to remind them of what's important or point out the things that need to be addressed. So, for example, as only the second black woman elected to the United States Senate, I took on a real role of leadership around black maternal mortality, which affects Black women and affects their spouses, their husbands, their families, their children. And I feel a sense of responsibility and a very strong duty to make sure that I use my voice and in a way that is about lifting up people who have not always been in the room America.\cb1 \

When I mentor young women and men, I remind them that you are often going to be told, well, it's not your time, not your turn, too young, nobody like you has done this before and and I tell them, you know, don't you ever listen to that?\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 You know there are two sides to the coin about when you have relationships in your life that touch you deeply, and then to lose that person, it leaves a big void. Right, That's the two sides, and I think that part of what I was just talking about this, But the big part about grief is, especially if you lose somebody to a sickness, to an illness, I think it's really important that you try to remember them as they lived and not as they died, because I think that's how they'd want us to remember them. But also to remember their suffering, which hopefully was a fraction of their time on this earth. Is to compound the grief in a way that I think it adds to the pain. And what they want is that their active memory, that our active memory of them is about when they were vibrant and alive.\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 The reason those came about is because there was a demmocratic majority in the House of Representatives in Congress, people like Maxine Waters, people like Hakeem Jeffries right, yes, who did the work of pushing to say people need help right now, and we need to send out checks.

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 Yes, that's why those checks. Remember Congress holds the purse. Yes, so really, Congress wrote those checks. But then Donald Trump, unlike any president before after, decided he put his name on those checks. So people thought Donald Trump, he gave me that check. And so let's clear that up first and foremost. But let's also deal with where he was in terms of his policies on the economy. He gave the biggest tax cuts for billionaires and the biggest corporations, which caused an incredible deficit. He tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which we also call Obamacare, which benefited so many people, including and in particular Black people in America who otherwise were denied by the insurance companies health coverage because of pre existing conditions.\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 That's most important. Let the people know, right, with Affordable Care Act, if you have a pre existing condition, insurance companies can no longer deny you coverage.\cb1 \

\cf2 \cb3 One create a fund so that we will give a twenty five thousand dollar down payment to first time homeowners to just help people get in the door. We will deal with the rent issue because part of what we're seeing in Atlanta and places across our countries, these corporations are buying up all these properties, which means then that they don't have to deal with competition between the properties, and they're jacking up rent costs. So it's about also going after that corporate gouging around what they're doing to buy up and then jack up the prices of rent. We also need to help people with small business ownership. I did even before I was running for president, a tour I called it the Opportunity Economy Tour, focused on black men and black entrepreneurs.\cb1 \

\cf2 \cb3 Hundred million dollars handed to him practically on a silver platter. And by the way, Shannon file for bankruptcy six times. Everybody wants to say he's a great businessman, take a look at his record. I know that so many of our entrepreneurs who have great ideas don't have access to capital, but they have serious work ethic, great ideas, and a plan to do the work. So part of my plan is to increase access to capital, including giving twenty thousand dollars forgivable loans for startup capital for people to buy the equipment, and then to change the tax deduction so whereas it is now five thousand dollars, to make it fifty thousand dollars to start a new business, because nobody can start a new business on five thousand dollars, and the direct benefit when we're looking at black entrepreneurs is profound and all it is is about saying this Americans in general, regardless of their racer gender, we have ambition, We have aspirations, we have dreams, but not everyone has access to the opportunity to let some actually accomplish that.\cb1 \

So you've probably heard about the once weekly shot that can help you lose an average of twenty percent of your weight in a year when combined with diet and exercise. But you also may have heard that out of pocket costs can be huge and figuring out insurance coverage is wild. Now Road is making it easier to see if you're covered for golp ones to help you get the best price out there. Want to hear my favorite part, They'll check for free. Yep, it won't cost you a dime to find out if your insurance will cover golp ones. One hundred thousand members in counting have trusted Road to check their coverage and get the mass at the best price possible. Depending on their insurance playing. Just submit your insurance card and ROLL will create a personal insurance coverage report so you can understand your options. Go to road dot co slash Shannon for your free insurance coverage report. That's ro dot co slash Shannon. Start losing weight sooner with GLP one's through row METMBP. If you were to become president, what measures would you put in place to make sure Social Security benefits continue? Because there are reports that it could possibly be depleted by twenty thirty three, and they're estimated that eleven thousand people turn at least sixty five years of age every single Yeah, so what are you going to do to make sure because that you know people disability to retirement survivors with beneficiary, what are you going to do to make sure that that continues?\cb1 \

\cf2 \cb3 Of income is a social Security check, correct, right, is they're the only way they're going to pay the rent or have food on the table. So my plan is about doing what we need to do to put the resources back into social security, but also expanding it because here's part of the problem of social security is that for our aging seniors, if they are a couple, for example, and one of the spouse passes, that cuts their social Security benefits almost in half. So part of my plan is to reconfigure it so that that surviving spouse does not then have a crisis where they've already lost their loved one. But we also just have to understand on a macro level, we've got to require that billionaires of corporations pay their fair share right they can afford to. And that's part of what is the difference between me and Donald Trump. My plan is about tax cuts for small businesses, for working people, for middle class people. One hundred million Americans will benefit around tax cuts. My plan is that no taxes will be raised for anybody making less than four hundred thousand dollars a year. My plan is that we give young parents a six thousand dollars child tax credit to help them pay for childcare for a crib bar or car seat, because you and I both know the vast majority of our young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources. And back to the way I was raised, I know that the children of the community are the children of the community that you and I will benefit from that young family having the resources they need. So it's about all of us benefiting. But it's a state of mind, and it's a perspective. Mine is about thinking about the challenges people face and getting them help. Donald Trump is full time focused on himself. You watch his rallies. He will spend full time talking about I was going to say, Freddy Krueger Hannibal Lecter might as well be Freddy Krueger Hannibal Lecter. He'll spend full time talking about his grievances, about what everyone has done to him. He'll talk about himself, but he does not talk about the American people. He does not talk about what he's going to do for middle class he does not talk about what he's going to do for families, for working people.\cb1 \

I think about it in terms of taking care of my mother when she was sick and dying from cancer. So one of my policies, for example, is to help Medicare pay for home health care for seniors. Why because look, I did it, and it means, you know, trying to cook for an elder, to make something they feel like eating, right, to help them put on a sweater. And we have so many people who are in the Sandwich generation. They're raising their young kids and taking care of their parents.\cb1 \

\cf2 \cb3 What is a no, What is a priority for me is making sure that access to health care is a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. That's why I am in favor of and have pushed and been a leader on capping the cost of insulent thirty five dollars a month. And why intend to allow Medicare to actually negotiate against the big pharmaceutical companies to bring down the cost of prescription medication for everybody. That's why I have fought for war we need to do around making sure Medicare covers senior care. Access to healthcare should not be a question of how much money you have in your back pocket. That's just not right, and I feel strongly about that.\cb1 \

I'll give you another example of why Donald Trump has not earned the support of folks to be president of the United States again. When he was president the last time during the height of COVID. During the height of COVID, one in three black Americans knew somebody who died from COVID. You remember those days, and people couldn't get their hands on a COVID test. At that very same time, Donald Trump as president, secretly sent COVID tests to the President of Russia for his personal use while Americans were dying every day.

And my pledge in this campaign to everyone, regardless of who you are, where you live, what you look like, I will be a president for all Americans, and I will work to bring our country back together because frankly, I think people are exhausted with the anger, with the hate, with the division, the attempt to have Americans pointing their fingers at each other. I think people are exhausting. It's not healthy for the productivity of our country. Do we want to strive? Do we want to thrive or do we want to spend full time with vengeance?

I've read some blacks say the problem that they have to you is that you're making political promises and that you're just pandering. The problem that I have with that it just seems like only black people pander. Like when other candidates go and shows and they say they're gonna do this, they're they're not pandering. They're telling you, laying out their elaborate plan on what they're going to do. But it seems to you when you promise that if I'm president, this is what I'm gonna do in the first ninety days, this is what I'm gonna do it. My administration's gonna do while I'm in office. You're pandering. How do you get through to those that says, look, this is what I'm going to do if I'm elected president. These are the policies, and they will lead to meaningful and impactful change.\cb1 \

We need to do better in getting information to people about what's available to them. So, for example, through the Small Business Administration, there are funds available to help people create a business plan, There is resources available to help people just know how that you need to run a payroll, how you need to pay business taxes. Part of my plan, by the way, is to simplify taxes for small businesses. I like to say, it's basically Dow gonna date myself, Like you remember the ten forty Did you ever have to do a ten forty?\cb1 \

But the work that I have done and will continue to do is about knowing that we don't lack for hard work, we don't lack for good ideas, but we do lack for information about the help that is available. So that's part of how it is going to be about increasing access to capital. Part of it is about putting more money. So I called up and got in touch with and worked with some of the big CEOs of the biggest corporations in America and said, and the big banks that you all don't necessarily you're not there in the community where you can get one hundred thousand dollars loan to a small business. You guys deal at a different level, but those one hundred thousand dollar loans for a startup will go a long way.\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 So first of all, I have personally prosecuted transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. I have prosecuted the Sinaloa cartel, Okay, the guadalajarror cartel. So I put my record up to anybody in terms of how strongly I feel about having a secure border and making sure that there is not that kind of trafficking into America. I also know that we need to put more resources at the border, which is why I supported a bill that came about, including from the most conservative members of Congress, to put fifteen hundred more border agents at the border to do what we need to do to cut down the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States, which is killing people of every race and background. With more resources would have gone to prosecuting human trafficking. Donald Trump got word of that bill, and he knew it would be a solution to a problem, which is that we have a broken immigration system. He got word of the bill and he told his friends in Congress, don't put it up for a vote, don't let it go any further, because you see, he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem, and is putting out tens of millions of dollars of campaign commercials full time trying to suggest that he cares about strengthening a border when he had an opportunity to participate in a solution, which he killed because he's not.\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 My point is we got to strengthen the border, and we need to have an immigration system that is fair and humane and strong in terms of making sure that people have to earn citizenship, they have to work hard to get it. My plan includes also strengthening what we need to do in terms of illegal entry in between ports of entry, what we need to do to put more support for border patrol agents, put more technology at the border. But it includes also you know, I'm never going to talk about people from Haiti eating their pets, and I think that we also know we don't want an immigration system that's about separating children from their parents. We can do it in a humane way. But the bottom line is we can fix these problems. The solutions are at hand. He stands in the world and in particular on this issue.\cb1 \

He is increasingly unstable and unfit to be president, according to the people who knew in best, all Republicans, by the way I just referred to, who know he is unfit to be commander, and she he who will talk about service members. A lot of your listeners and the people who are a fan of your show have served or do serve in the United States military. He talks about military service members as being uncourageous, as being cowards, suckers, and losers. This is how the man talks. And so let's not get distracted by who he was on the Apprentice. Let's not get distracted by whatever you know building in whatever city in Vegas or wherever has his name on it. Let's look at the job of president of the United States and is he fit to do that job? And by the people who know him best, including some most recently a four star Marine general, his former chief of staff, they all say, those who know him best, he is unfit and dangerous.\cb1 \

Yes, to the point they question whether they can have a family, whether they can can retire at some point where they could buy a home. So that's why I pushed for what we did around student loan debt. And thankfully, for example, we have billions of dollars in student loan debt reliefs that have gone, for example, to public servants like teachers and nurses and firefighters.\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 And the court just took that right away from women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do. And I think an important emphasis for me is you don't have to give up your faith or deeply held beliefs on this subject to agree. The government shouldn't be telling her what to do. If she chooses, she'll talk with her pastor, her priest, or rabbi, her a mom, but not the government telling her. And we need to fight against us. We need to understand how many women are suffering miscarriage and being denied help because the doctors are afraid they may land up in jail. In Texas, do you know they provide prison for life for doctors or nurses who provide reproductive prison for life?\cb1 \
