we have an exclusive interview with vice president Kamala Harris it is her first one-on-one interview the major Network since she became the Democratic nominee
play today my colleague Stephanie ruhle sat down with vice president in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
for an in-depth conversation about the economy
I'm going to bring you that interview in a moment
today vice president Harris made her economic pitch to voters ahead of election day also in Pittsburgh
intend to chart
a NuWave
and grow America's middle class
Donald Trump
intends to take America back
you see for Donald Trump
our economy works best
if it works for those who own
the big skyscrapers
not those who actually build them
vice president said more than a hundred million Americans will get a middle-class tax break she vowed to lower housing costs the sharp contrast to Donald Trump who's economic policies consist of new tariffs on all imported goods
tax cuts for corporations in the wealthy continuation of the first term
unprecedented Crackdown on immigration in Mass deportation scheme
along with a grab bag of random proposals suggested by Elon Musk and other billionaire
it's an agenda the Goldman Sachs when analyzing said would weaken the economy
and on the other hand analysts have predicted a very slight boost to GDP investment due to higher corporate tax rates if vice president Harris wins
Pollo Americans are starting to feel better about the economy days it's been really interesting
Trump now averages a 6 percentage Point Edge on the economy compared with a 12-point lead against President Biden earlier this year
that's an according to an analysis of five poles before and after Biden dropped
inflation is down significantly
from those high peaks in 2022 20/23 the employment rate remains unemployment rate remains near historic clothes
but at the same time many critical swing voters still don't see how they will personally benefit
from the Democratic party's economic
vice president Harris wants them to think otherwise shedding more light on her economic plan to as she says grow the middle class in a one-on-one interview with Stephanie
your
Madam vice president you just laid out your economic vision for the future but still there are lots of Americans who don't see themselves in your plans for those who say these policies aren't for me
what do you say
well if you are hard-working if you have
the dreams and the Ambitions in the aspirations of
but I believe you do you're in my plan you know I have to tell you I really
love and I'm so
energized by what I know to be the spirit and character of the American people we have ambition
we have aspirations we have dreams
we can see what's possible we have an incredible work ethic
but not everyone has the access to the opportunities that allow them to achieve those things but we don't lack for those things
and so my vision for the economy I call it an opportunity economy is about making sure that all Americans wherever they start wherever they are have the ability to actually achieve those those dreams and those Ambitions which include from middle class families
just being able to to know that their hard work allows them
an economy that just allows people to get by people want to do more than just get by they want to get ahead and I come from the middle class like my mother raised my sister and me she worked hard
she saved up by the time I was a teenager she was able to buy her first home and
elusive you know gone is the day of everyone thinking they could actually live the American dream so part of my vision for the economy is let's deal with some of the everyday challenges that people face and address them with common sense Solutions such as affordable housing
over the last 4 years there have been tremendous economic wins and you've just laid out a big plan but still
polling shows that more like most likely voters still think Donald Trump is better to handle the economy why do you think that is
well here's what I know in terms of the facts
Donald Trump
I left us with the worst economy since the Great Depression when you look at for example the employment numbers it was during covid and employment was so high because we shut down the government which shut down the country even before the pandemic he lost manufacturing jobs by most people's estimates at least 200,000 he lost manufacturing plants as the Auto Workers
how he lost Auto plants we have grown over 20 new auto plants he has an agenda let's just deal with right now going forward not to mention what happened in the past he has an agenda that would include making it more difficult for workers to earn overtime
an agenda that would include cutting off access to small business loans for small businesses and agenda that includes tariffs to the point that the average working person will spend 20% more on everyday necessities
and an estimated $4,000 more a year on those everyday Necessities to the point that top economists in our country from Nobel laureates
people at at Moody's in Goldman Sachs
would shrink the economy some of them have actually assessed that his plan would increase inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year so the facts remain
that Donald Trump has a history of taking care of very rich people
and I'm not mad at anybody for being rich but they should pay their fair share
tax cuts for the
billionaires in the top corporations in our country
and then not really paying much attention to middle class Families my perspective on the economy is when you grow the middle class America's economy is stronger and there's empirical evidence to prove my point correct
I don't know what's going to happen next year
under a Harris Administration
at what income level should someone expect their taxes to go up and that state and local tax deduction that's currently capped and matters to a lot of people in blue states are you going to lift that cab so first of all when it relates to anybody making less than $400,000 a year your taxes will not go
your taxes will not go up and in fact under my plan
taxes for 100 million Americans will actually be cut including
6,000 a year for for young couples for the first year of their child's life and a tax cut a tax credit essentially by expansion of the child tax credit
and why is that because during the first year
of a young couple of a of a person's child's life they're going to need help buying a crib buying a car
and we all benefit when they're actually able to do what they naturally want to do to take care of their child and expanding that child tax credit or you mentioned housing before giving that extra money for a first home
if you can't raise corporate taxes or if GOP takes control of the sin
where do you get the money to do that do you still go forward with those plans and borrow
but we're going to have to raise corporate taxes and we're going to have to raise
we're going to have to make sure that the biggest corporations
billionaires pay their fair share that's just it it's about paying their fair share
I'm not mad at anyone for achieving success
but everyone should pay their fair share and it is not right that the teachers in the firefighters that I meet every day across our country or paying a higher tax
then the richest people in our country Bill Gates just said it this week if he was in charge of taxes he would have paid more but how do you find that line to make sure corporations are paying their fair share but they're not leaving our country
Williston I work with a lot of CEOs I have spent a lot of time with CEOs and I'm going to tell you that the Business Leaders who are actually part of the engine of America's economy
agree that people should pay their fair share they also agree that
when we look at a plant such as mine that is about investing in the middle class investing in new Industries investing in bringing down costs invest in entrepreneurs like small businesses that the overall economy is stronger and everyone benefits part of my plan
for the economy is investing in new Industries in a way that we have active partnership
I've worked with the private sector of my entire career I even as vice president working with some of the biggest banks and biggest tech companies
increase by billions of dollars the money going into Community Banks to increase
access to capital for small businesses why do those
biggest corporations in CEOs do that because they know
those kinds of Investments like in our small businesses in startups and entrepreneurs actually strengthens America's economy overall and everyone benefits so this is not about bilking anybody but it is certainly about saying let's make sure that we create opportunities for everyone to grow wealth I believe that
it is not sufficient and it should not be our goal to just make sure everyone is working that should be the Baseline that should be a given
and let's create an economy where people have the ability to buy a home to start a business
to take a nice vacation from time to time right for people who want to buy a home yes getting a $25,000 kicker would be great
are regulations and rules strict strict rules at a local level how does the federal government
I know the suburbs of Pittsburgh and say we're going to have to build some affordable housing here how do you connect the two
so you're absolutely right so across our country
people rightly are concerned about the cost of housing so is homeownership to your point we need more Supply
that is without any question part of the solution creating more Supply under my plan includes creating tax incentives to work with the private sector and home builders part of my goal and the plan would be to create 3 million new housing units for rent and for ownership by the end of my first term it includes also what we must do to cut red tape you're absolutely right it takes far too long and there's too much bureaucracy
associated with home building and I say that as a devout public servant I know that we have to reduce the red tape and speed up what we need to do around building and that is going to require working from the federal level with state and local governments and it's going to be different in different places depending on the needs of that Community the needs of that local government that municipality but working in consultation and coordination and also around incentives that we can create for example
some of the work is going to be through what we do in terms of giving benefits and assistance to State local governments around Transit dollars
and looking holistically at the connection between that and
and looking holistically at the incentives when the federal government can create for local and state governments to actually engage in planning in holistic manner
that includes prioritizing affordable housing
coming up much more of Stephanie rules exclusive interview with vice president Kamala Harris on steelworkers unions near plans to go after
Rebecca more Stephanie rules exclusive interview with vice president Kamala
a Japanese company wants to buy them
you are opposed to this idea many people are but if the deal doesn't go through
Dave said people could lose jobs they could close meals they could leave the state of Pennsylvania I mean that is like moving the Liberty Bell to Newark
so which is more important
it's most important that
we maintain
America's ability to have American manufacturing of Steel by American workers for a number of reasons
which includes again back to the point of growing our economy and how I think about the economy overall investing in new Industries there is not a new industry
that I can imagine that is not going to require steel as a manufacturing of Steel as a fundamental part of what it accomplishes
and having American workers in an American company
manufacturing that steel for those new Industries is going to be critically important not only in terms of our economy but also in the context of National Security
most people now realize if we didn't before the pandemic
and and and and the strain on Supply chains and an over-reliance on foreign Manufacturing
that we have to be intentional about us-based Manufacturing
and of the the the the the products
that we have to prioritize steal is one of them and that's always going to be my priority steelworkers
he saw them there was an emotional connection
but not all unions have gotten behind you I want to understand when the teamsters decided not to endorse you
what was the reasoning what are they looking for
well let me go back to her just previous conversation I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the steel workers and almost every other major Union in America because I stand by workers and I stand by The Importance of Being able to join a union and and to understand that the benefit of the value of unions and I understand the importance of investing in new Industries and working actively with the private sector to grow our economy but I'm asking because there's this idea we want something more from her what is it well here's the thing that back to your point about previous election Cycles Donald Trump made a whole lot of promises
did not meet and one would argue
look at Lordstown
he said he was going home and what happened it shut down Outsourcing under Donald Trump his policies that are about putting you know tends to hundreds of percent tariffs John Deere yes
yes so part of the challenge and I don't disagree that it's a challenge got to earn the vote of everybody is reminding people of fact
regardless of what somebody says in a small rally somewhere
and I think that's really important and that's part of what I'm doing in this campaign is to remind people
just like here in Pittsburgh
of the reality of who has stood with union labor who stands for American manufacturing who stands for American jobs can I ask you about tariffs because you just mentioned it it's not just with one company Donald Trump sort of big idea is this broad-based tariffs across the board
you and many others have said that would be not only disastrous but it would be a direct tax on the American Consumer would be a sales tax on the American people that the independent economists have already measured this
by the sales tax of doing a 20% tariff
on All Imports that he has described
would be a 20% sales tax in essence on basic necessities for the average American worker average American family totaling almost $4,000 a year that is no small matter here in Pittsburgh
when I'm talking to a group of folks who work here who live here
and when they hear it might be $4,000 more a year for them
he's actually looking to potentially Implement more
where do you come out on is there a good pair of a bad time but part of it is you don't just throw around the idea of just tariffs across the board and that's part of the problem with Donald Trump frankly I'm going to and I say this in all sincerity
he's just not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues
and one must be serious
and have a plan and a real plan it's not just about some talking
ending in an exclamation
add a political rally but actually putting the thought into what will be the return on the investment what will be the economic impact on everyday people
and when you look at my plans
25,000 down payment assistance for first-time home buyers you know what that means then you're creating the ability of that working person to build intergenerational
doing the work of a thousand-dollar child tax credit doing the work of a $50,000 tax deduction for first-time
small businesses startups because right now because right now and again it's about paying attention to the detail and being serious about it
I'm serious about my enthusiasm and my for small businesses and my belief in what they will do as part of America's economic engine looking at the fact that right now the tax deduction is 5000 nobody in this year of Our Lord 2024 and start a small business with $5,000 very few can
tax deduction for startups
to Jenner
The Innovation and the the the the the ambition
the ideas that are present in among us but need the fuel to be able to actually achieve the goal
over the last few years has been inflation luckily it's cooling but prices are still hot with you you said you want to take this on
by going after those who engage in price gouging
but as somebody who supports free markets who's the capitalist
how do you go after price gouging without implementing price controls because once we get in the zone people start to get worried and they say I don't know what she stands for so
just to be very Frank
I am never going to apologize for going after
companies incorporations that take advantage of the desperation of the American people and as attorney general I saw this happen in the midst of an emergency whether it be an extreme weather event or even the pandemic we saw it
were those few companies not the majority not most
but those few companies that would take advantage of the desperation of people and jack up prices yeah I'm going to go after them yes I'm going to go after them
and that is part of
a much more comprehensive plan on what we can do to bring down
the cost of living including
housing including the everyday needs of the American
coming up more of Stephanie rules interview with vice president Kamala Harris or she addresses Trump's claim that he is a
protector of women
what's next
we're back with more Stephanie rules exclusive interview with vice president Kamal
on Friday you are going to The Border immigration is complicated one of the issues is an economic one
and no one is eating cats and dogs in Springfield Ohio and I'm glad not to be talking about that but there are people there
that are stressed that feel that they're at capacity communities around the country that have legal immigration many have said we're we're at capacity
what would a Harris Administration do for those communities who have taken in many many legal immigrants but are at capacity well first of all
we do have a broken immigration system and it needs to be fixed and if we take a step back months ago some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress came together with others
proposed a border security bill
that would have put 1500 new border agents On the Border to help those hard-working border agents were there right now working around the clock would have put more money into stemming the flow of fentanyl which is killing
Americans around our country and devastating communities would have put more resources into our ability to prosecute transnational criminal organizations which in my career I prosecuted
Donald Trump got word of the bill
realize it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on and told him to kill the bill don't put it up for a vote he killed a bill that would have actually been a solution cuz he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem and that's part of what needs to be addressed and my pledge is that when elected president
if the American people will have me
I will bring that bill back and I will sign it into law and we need
a comprehensive
that includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border but deal with the fact that we also need to create Pathways for people to earn citizenship and I want to just ask you about a little job and a big job the first one just a fact check because your opponent is a little today there's no such thing as a joke OK Google
have you
to all beef patties Special Sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun OK Google
part of the reason I even talked about having worked at McDonald's is because
there are people who work at McDonald's in our country who are trying to raise a family I work there as a student I was a kid
who worked there trying to raise families and pay rent on
and I think part of the difference between me and my opponent
includes our perspective on the needs
of the American people
and what are responsibility then is to meet those needs
you have laid
policy in great detail
but the economy is an unpredictable Beast
and you are running for a job that takes extraordinary Instinct and guts
what's the last time you were to make a gut deck
probably the biggest got decision I've made
most recently is to choose my running
there are lots of good incredible
candidates
I know I'm out of time but then I just want to ask you a question from my gut okay because today we're talking about reproductive excuse me we were talking about the economy
and people don't think often about Reproductive Rights being an economic issue but it is
a woman's ability to plan her future her education her life
he helped women he protected women he says they're miserable today they're poor today they're more vulnerable today
he said he will be the protector of women
can you respond to that
so Donald Trump
is also the person who said women should be punished
for exercising
a decision that they rightly should be able to make about their own body and their future
so I think
we would all agree that as a result of that perspective that he has about women
he also then chose three members of the United States Supreme Court who did as he intended
when did the protections of Roe v Wade and now and stayed after State you see laws being passed that do punished women
law
I mean most recently a heartbreaking story
resulted in a young woman
the mother of a 6 year old
heartwrenching stories
and that's for The Listener much less their family
look I think the thing about Donald Trump is that you know I don't think the women of America need him to say he's going to protect them the women of America
I'm not perfect
but I will tell you I'm always going to put the needs of the people first
Madam vice president thank you for your time today thank you
Stephanie ruhle NBC News senior business analyst hosted on Stephanie can just say that was a great interview
and I thought you pressed her on really important stuff it was it was also I just thought it was the whole thing was refreshingly substantive
this was you know you can say I don't like that policy or I do like that policy but it really was about like
hear the Earth we live in
the kinds of decisions you're going to make and it wasn't Pie in the Sky stuff so very very well done job let me just start by
okay well I'm just going to sit here and soak in those compliments so we don't have to talk about anything else but I think what you're actually complimenting
is that it was a normal interview Chris that's actually what it was it was a normal interview it was a person running to be the president of the United States and for 25 minutes we talked about their vision and we talked about policy and I think you just said it right there at the end of the day it's okay if you don't like her policies right she made it very clear if you make over 400 Grand a year next year when the when the when the individual tax cuts expire she's going to raise your taxes so if you were someone who just votes on that well then you know what are you doing you don't want to vote for her
I think that it's just that we're so desensitized and that so many interviews that that we do we're forced to cover so much lunacy or so much crazy or so much fat checking your get distracted by so many issues that aren't poor policies that serve the American people what you saw right there was just a sort of a classic interview with somebody running for president I thought the point that there's a number of really interesting exchanges I thought the exchanges on terrorist was really interesting particularly when you said look which is true you know I think people
people think we live in this free trade era which we do compared to previous but there's also lots of Tears on lots of stuff presidents have unbelievably unilateral authority to apply them I remember George W bush doing this on aluminum and steel I remember obviously Trump did it Joe Biden as you noted you basically said look where are you and what I thought her answer was interesting which is basically like
well it kind of depends right but we're not going to throw up a 20% tariff around the whole country which is not a serious idea
but I think that's the important part sort of the Nuance because I'm going to be honest
President Biden has tariffs in place he's held a lot of Donald Trump's tariffs in place and the White House doesn't like to talk about it they don't like it when you ask them about it because everybody has gotten in this zone of like Trump's Tower of guy we're not the Tower of people we're here on the other side and what she did right there is kind of explain
but it's complicated 330 million people are economy is complicated right in the same way as the economy good or bad it totally depends so tariffs if used in the right places can work and one could watch that and say well she didn't give a clear direct answer that's okay because we are not talking about clear or direct issues
the question about
inflation and prices this to me is one of the sort of one of the most frustrating aspects of this campaign
the thing that people are 100% correctly rationally and understandably reacting to
is 2 or 3 years of the highest rate of inflation we've had in a generation
which was it has been incredibly unpleasant it's spiked the prices of things things got more expensive
the issue of course is that that period was
basically born of the end of the pandemic and the supply Crunch and a combination of that and monetary policy has brought it down
so now you got this weird situation where both major party candidates kind of got to say what they're going to do to bring prices down
even though whatever was reacting to is
an issue that is not that is a little bit in the past you see what I'm saying like so she's got the price down anything which I thought was a good answer but in some ways it is a little really talking about the real thing
