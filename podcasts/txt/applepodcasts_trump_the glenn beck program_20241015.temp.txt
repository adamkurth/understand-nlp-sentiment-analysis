here is
interview part 1 with Donald Trump
Mr President
yes hi Glenn how are you
I'm good I'm good
I hear you just got off the phone with Elon Musk how did that go I did
amazing world all by himself he's a fantastic guy
when I said that rocket ship come down yesterday I said you got to be kidding the way it landed
United States we were we were talking I think he is
one of the great I mean Steve Jobs maybe is in his category I don't think that I think he's the greatest mind and and not theoretical actually doing stuff in my lifetime yeah and he's a big supporter I know
makes me feel good he knows what's going on he think
the most important election ever so
are you
have you been serious about allowing him to go in and look for cuts and everything
essentially scientists and
he feels that this tremendous
he feels it's there and you know I can say if you could save a lot of money and and make lives better okay you get more for the buck but
he would like to do something having to do with the budget
cuz it's tremendous waste oh yeah and so and he's good at finding that I mean the way he runs his companies
I mean it's tremendous
is maybe the best at finding that help people love it when they hear that without making any Dent to you know and make people's lives better actually it really
is is such a statement
that he's probably the the most effective person on the planet of Looking Over the Horizon and then bringing tomorrow into today
and the and the left because he likes you
he is
I mean they just they will shut him down
yep they will they try
he's hard to shut down because
show Advanced he's on a different playing field he's so
you shut him down you shut the country down essentially when you look
oh look at starlink so he had starlink
in North Carolina they called is there any way you
call and and some great people in North Carolina suffer
and you know they have no Communications whatsoever and I got I called him
other than this supposed to be good
and I called him and he added to them immediately Now They delayed him you know they delayed him we were
they put they put a hold on you know what he did we were on the ground my my charity Mercury one was on the ground we were one of the first people on the ground we were running at
at the height I think we were running 50 helicopters and we had it all you know I mean we had everything we were there with elon's guy when they started
jerking his chain they even came and tried to shut us down in Ark I looked and said
you know you don't have a single helicopter here we're saving people in the mountains if you were here maybe a week ago sure but we're not shutting down
I mean it's it was really tragic what they did it's one of the worst rescues
ever and I think in a league with Katrina which was pretty bad some people say it's worse
and then they didn't let him do it I know cases I think that's I think that's one of the biggest things that
you know when you say we're going to take our country back one of the biggest things that I miss is
the the ability to just do things that you feel are right that are legal but to just
control of your own life the the government has grown so far out of control it's in every aspect of our life and it is the problem
Edison nasty government it's a mean government
the weaponized government
and they've done things and you know it's interesting because the people aren't very smart
you know the people on
I'm not on top the people that surround them they are smart
individuals and their fascists and everything else you can be so it's a nasty group of people so somebody is is quite smart I mean sometime historian
we'll look back and say this was
a genius it was the biggest heist in human history it was horrible
but it was genius who's actually the president
well I think it's a it's a committee of people and they might not even know the committee is they may not even know themselves does that make
it's a group of people
that are in different levels of DC
and they surround the man that was not
the most capable person
she's worse than he is she's worse than he
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Pocahontas okay Pocahontas is probably for the left of Bernie I think I don't know how you how you write I might have to go buy your scale I believe in your scale maybe more than mine but but if you think about it you know we have some people and she is considered the most left in
in the entire Senate and not the smartest
and not by any means the smartest in fact maybe the opposite but she is I mean when you say she's worse I mean we were talking yesterday to Mike Lee about
you know her centerpiece legislation when she was in the Senate which I think was called Do no harm and it just dismantles religious freedom just entirely dismantles
we spent a lot of time
yesterday with the Latter Day Saints
some incredible people and people of religion too just people of religion
she's against religion and it's in her but it's in her
she's against religion and I don't know how people can vote for her
we were talking about not so much you took cuz we have such a big lead there
we were talking about Arizona
and you know do you take a look at Arizona and I would certainly say in Nevada
and you have a lot of Latter-day Saints Mormons in those areas
if we got I think we're at 88% I mean if we got 1% more or 2% more
and this whole country would turn around because if we won those
we would be an awfully good shape to win the whole thing is as you know so we spend time together and it was it was great and when I mentioned your name
I will say I mentioned Glenn's name everyone in the place went crazy so they like you like you a lot that was a big audience I it was amazing they're electric I mean I you know you at one point lean over to me and
what's your cat say and you know the you know the figures are you better than I do
my God says you're accelerating at exactly the right time and as I said to you
but for cheating
you told me that we've made a lot of good Headroom or Headway on that
well I think just by nature of that we don't have covid they use covid to
and they did so many things so many different things but just the fact that they didn't get legislative approval I mean that's you don't have to go any further than that they actually go for legislative approval not get it you know like let's say it's a republican legislature
not get it and then do it anyway it was just terrible and
they use covid to cheat now that number one that in itself makes it better now
but they are very devious group and you know it better than maybe anybody and you talk about it more openly a lot of people
well once you've been threatened by George Soros once you've been threatened by George Soros it kind of just everything else is kind of
which is so crazy
it's so crazy
Kamala Harris is cut from that exact same clo
yes or no that's a way of talking about it you know
I had a tremendous rally the night before the night before yesterday
and it was unbelievable and we and you heard about 100 million people have a
honest election if we had
God coming down to be our vote counter wouldn't that be great if we can ask God to do it that would be the ultimate vote counter right because
I I think I do great I think we do great in California
I think would win it well you know they send
like 38 million dollars to a 36 million dollars they go all over the place
and then they come pouring back
and
you know when you go and vote into a really good solid state where you have a real and they look at you and they want your ID even if you're Trump say yes sir please
could I see your license could I see it
there's no games you really can't get away with anything I know but they don't have computerized machines
do they have a paper ballots and they have voter ID and everything else have you have you talked to Elon Musk about this cuz I think with I mean
you know this we can transfer billions of dollars and not a penny is lost we do it all day long and it's fine
how come we can't get the technology to lock this into place especially with block
so Elon is the number one person for
Mechanical Devices including computers there's nobody
and yet he says the only way to do it really safely is with paper ballots you know it's like something right
he said I consider myself to be the world's greatest expert on all such things as this type of equipment right I would say I put him in number one
you can make things swing and you can make things to a lot of bad things
he said but you can't do it with paper ballots when you know they have believe it or not they have paper now that's actually very highly sophisticated
Gavin Newsom
you're not even allowed to ask somebody whether or not
if you do I think it's like a criminal act or
it's Joseph countries gone totally crazy right now you're listening to the best of the Glenn Beck program and don't forget to check out the full show for even more we're back with more after a word from our sponsor part 2 is coming up in just a minute about his experience I've been suffering from a lot of pain in my back and my right foot for over two decades now I've tried everything
to make it go away and nothing has worked then about a year ago I heard Glenn yapping about my words not his he said talking about relief factor and I thought I'd give it a shot not only did my pain go away it is stayed away ever since then thank you relief
you are welcome thank you for trying it out 70% of the people who try to go on to order more month after month it doesn't work for everybody but I appreciate the fact that they give you a 3-week quick start trial it's 1995 and they say
if it's not working for you in 3 weeks it's probably not going to work for you
I love that it's not like yeah you
it's working you're just too dumb to notice that your pain hasn't gone away
relief factor.com call them now 1-800 the number for Relief 1-800 the number for Relief it's relief factor.com now back to the podcast you're listening to the best of the Glenn Beck program you and I were talking the other day about the the hidden Trump vote
and I want to ask you your thoughts on on something I think there's actually
a hidden Trump
that is going to come from Democrats
because they didn't convince people of these policies
they scared them into it they taught them shut your mouth and just go along with it and I think reasonable Democrats are going this doesn't work I don't want my kids being talked to buy you know a teacher in secret that's that's that's that's the sign of a predator I am paying more for my groceries I can't do it anymore and I think there's a
a slice of the Democrats
that might tell everybody there for Kamal
we'll go in and vote for you what do you think of that so I think the biggest
okay you know you see the polls in the polls have the economy number one in inflation I view them as the same thing in a sense I think the inflation and economy you can wrap them up into
I actually think and I may be wrong but
you know nothing wrong by much I think the biggest the biggest thing that people are going to be looking at and voting on is what's happening at our border
where murderers are allowed to come in and where drug dealers are allowed to come in and just destroy our country literally just right and inflation is a destroyer of the country too but it's a different kind of
it's a different kind of a destroyer it's not as mean not as mean as having guys coming in with machine guns I have to go ahead well I was going to say I don't know if you've heard this yet I want to play some audio this is Bill Clinton
today talking about Lake and Riley listen to this is all been properly vetted that probably wouldn't have happened
but if they are properly vetted and that doesn't happen and America is not having enough babies to keep our populations up so we need immigrants that have been vetted to do work
there wouldn't be a problem
I mean he sounds like he's campaigning for you
yep that's that's come a long way you see that's probably where they're going
anybody comes in just walk right into our country which is in
and now all of a sudden you're hearing people talking about well you know we need people to come in come
21 million people came in hundreds of thousands of those people
from prisons and from
and drug lords and human traffickers and murderers and they
so we have a problem before he's a little late and saying it because we have a big problem we have people in our country that are
going to be murdering a lot of people
Lincoln Riley
beautiful young lady I know the parents I know everything about her what happened to her is just horrible
but you have many many cases like that some you don't hear about but they're they're Aurora
Venezuelan street gangs have done they
and they take it over
JD Vance was talking to Martha raddatz by the way brilliant
he says Martha are you listening to yourself
you think this little problem is is is is is little
there are Venezuelan gangs that are running apartment buildings in America it's amazing what these people will try to excuse
not believable when you say it JD's been great by the way I love him
and as good as he's been Waltz on the other side
Superman even a little intelligent
I mean it's just it's just incredible I know you're I know your son I know I know your son is a hunter you have to ask him Play that video of him trying to load the shotgun
I swear to you I mean I'm fairly decent with guns I would not hunt with that guy he looks like he's dangerous with a gun he's never done that
now we'll see how it works out on November 5th because
one way or the other if they if they won I guess he was in a horrible pic but when I heard that they picked him I couldn't believe it and he's only gotten worse and she's gotten worse so she's worse than I really believe that she's worse than
Biden was is superior and they're fighting like cats and dogs to tell them so you think that's you think that's true
oh yeah no well he's angry because
he got 14 million votes and he was thrown out he was this was an overthrow of a president I know this was an overthrow of an American president has never been anything like that before
and they came to see him and they said we want you out
I'm amazed to agree to it actually
and you know the truth is she looks better than he ever did he looks better than he did for
for 5 years I don't know somehow he didn't play well as president but
he does play well the way he's playing against like
Ron Ron DeSantis in Florida instead of very good on the hurricane Irma but he's done a very good job
the way she went at him
no that's crazy
Bill Clinton clip I'm just wondering are they just like
cutting her lo
I know I think they're trying to steer a different path now I think this thing is not working and we've
a very good run for 3 weeks and I think they're saying it's not working she's changed 15 major policies
you probably you're the only time Pro I would say if you've seen
any candidate for high office change to it would be a lot oh yeah remember John Kerry I think changed one or two things and he became you know the waffle man
fracking to Crime to this to that to
I wish to see all of a sudden now wants to have a strong bord
and she acts like nothing happened you know where was she for 4 years right but but I've never seen anything like it if you go back 2 years just go back into or just go back into that Prim
and listen to what she said and what she voted for
and now every one of those things have been thrown out so I don't know you know I mean
let's see what happens I can't imagine you could get away with it
but there's another thing it's called comp
and you know she they tried to threat to democracy with me they tried it all they tried everything
but let's look at now their comp
the woman is not a competent person and I think far less comp
I never thought I'd be saying
but there's something going on I mean I watched over the teleprompter teleprompter broke and she kept going that was amazing
no I said what's going on with him
you've been in television I've been a television we know teleprompters she had no idea what the next sentence was she was saying 32 as if hey prompter person I'm at the bottom of the page it was crazy
if that and you know what she could even say
my teleprompter
and sometimes I do that and then you go on to make your speech you know you can't sit there and you can't walk off the stage right now but but
a teleprompter is one of the most unreliable pieces of equipment like the crowd we had we had that was a big truck the night before I had 101,000 people
I figured teleprompters go out
5% of the time and two or 3% of the time where they're just
I mean I've had a blow up the stage you know if it's windy they're not very good cuz they move like a sound you can't they're very hard to hold
is
it's a problem
you've got to be if you're going to be in politics you have to be able to
but if and when the teleprompter goes you know this you've got to be able to speak
and she was frozen and she's lucky that thing came back because you know it snap back it's called a snapback
she then started continuing to me I wish it wouldn't I would have loved to see how she would have ended that
well I think it would have been a bad thing and she was she
she couldn't have done the 32 one more time
what frightens at least me is
she's not in control
Biden's not in control and they're talking about changing our nuclear strategy with Russia
and I don't know who's making those decisions and
I have to tell you Mr President I mean
have you read nuclear war by Annie Jacobsen
yes I have okay that's terrifying I don't know how you would make the decision as president of the United States that quickly
that is the biggest single threat
when these people talk about global warming and they worry about the oceans going to rise in 300 years by an 8th of an
it just infuriates
at the same time I don't even like talking about nuclear right how bad it is okay so you know during my Administration you probably never heard the word nuclear I don't I purposely
and now you're hearing it every single day you're hearing it all the time and you know issues it a lot is Putin now he's saying that word I know I know and that will be
they will never have been anything like that the level of power I'm the one that rebuilt
I rebuilt all of our military rebuilt it at the highest level I hate it in many ways I hated to have to do the nuclear but I did because we have no choice
other countries we have five other countries now that
as they say nuclear capable
and that's too many that's actually 5 too
the truth is I think I would have had a deal with Russia and with China
2D nuclearization I really think we would have had
all three of us agreed on it conceptually and I think we would have done that but covid came along and we had to fight that battle
and we thought it will never get credit for it really but we fought it well
I got credit for the economy I got credit for the military we knocked out Isis
got the biggest tax cuts and regulation go to that but I never got cut you know nobody knew what this was covid came in it was a gift from China I got it I got to tell you the way they the way they say that you didn't do enough when they were the ones bitching when you said I got to close to China we can't have this happen
and they they called you a big head and everything and now they're saying you didn't close it fast enough I mean are we do they really believe the American people are goldfish
Nancy Pelosi crazy Nancy she was going crazy when I said if I didn't close it from China then and you know what their 11 people in
and I was the only one that said I wanted
and you had to close it we would have
probably a couple of million people more and and we really
I mean we would have lost millions of people more had I not done that that was a great move
but you know nobody knew what this thing was and everybody got hurt that you know proportionately a lot of there was a lot of equals okay they all got her China ended up getting hurt very late in the process
almost scared of the issue it has really
you know people died of starvation can you believe that
either forgot or something happened but they didn't unwell them
it's unbelievable unbelievable but I was a terrible thing I have been bitching and complaining about the Secret Service for well since Obama
we have
we have not been protecting our presidents
my people have gotten around the Secret Service
however I will tell you this
this weekend
I have never seen anything like the security that you have around you now it is
top
and they said that you asked the president for
rocket launchers or something to protect your plane
in case somebody shoots a rocket at the plane is that true
well I better not get into it but they have a very strong security around the plane very strong security
and and they really
I mean they have to the one thing that we don't have is we haven't had a president saying if some country
where there is actually a
if they do anything that you were going to obliterate the country
because when you say that that's the end of that they won't do anything but
and we haven't heard that and other presidents have is
Brock you know
proclamations as you probably have heard
there were two or three of them issue that way where even Rivals Rivals were being threatened and
a certain presidents were able to get up and say if you do this we're going to hit you so hard that you won't have a country left and when you do that they tend to say well let's take a password
but Biden is not
is not I guess not willing to do that
