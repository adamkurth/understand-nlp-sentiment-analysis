I want to see a few things about the podcast before we jump right into it the first is
I am an Unapologetic
Harris wall suppor
I have studied leadership for the last couple of decades I have been inside of many many of the Fortune 100 companies kind of in this country and around the world inside of ngos worked with military leaders leadership is something that's really important to me and
this conversation is really the conversation that I insist on having
with CEOs and executive directors and Military commanders before I agree to do work within their organization you know if you take a CEO and corporate sector I can listen to earnings calls I can track stocks I can read engagement data and performance data
but what's really important to me is to sit down with a leader
and understand their capacity for full presence
understand their values understand what they believe in
why they're fighting for what they're fighting for and that's what this conversation is
I think vice president Harris has done an incredible job speaking to policy writing about policy if you go to her website there's detailed policy everything from foreign policy Economic Policy abortion
guns the things that matter from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep
this is a conversation about who is she what does she believe in why is she fighting
I will tell you that
in terms of high-performance high-stress leaders
I've met very few as solid as vice president Harris I'm excited to bring you into the conversation
vice president
vice president Kamala Harris welcome to us hey Google thank you
drilled and ready to dig in
we're going to start where we start all of these
tell us your story
and start from the very beginning
I've heard bits and pieces but I want to I'm going to ask hard questions along the way okay so I am one of two daughters who we were raised primarily by my mother my parents divorced when I was five and I'm the eldest and my mother had two goals in her life to raise her two daughters and to end breast cancer
and one of the very few women and certainly one of the very few women of color and a lot of my
work on women's health was formed you know
growing up
listening to her and watching her passion about the need for women to have dignity in the Healthcare System we grew up in an incredible neighborhood where
the kids we would ride our bikes
and so I had the blessing of a really great childhood because it was like it was a working-class neighborhood of you know I tried to explain to people
have you ever known a neighborhood where people are they're proud of their lawn oh yeah
you know what I mean
out
Trim in their roses out there mowing their lawn and just pride and neighborhood pride and Community it was the kids of the community
we were raised
where I talked about this which is that I had
and have an incredible family
and it is the family that I have that is by Blood and it is the family that I have by love
and that's how I was raised that you create your family as much as you are born into your family right right
and so I grew up with you know this expectation also
a joke about it we were raised in a community of people that told all of us as kids that we were special
we weren't particularly special but
they told us we were and we believed them right and I think that
in parenting
there are certain things that we do for the children in our lives that teachers do so beautifully that we can all do that is just about
inspiring a kid
believe that they are loved and they are special
and then you create a high standard for them and they know they're supposed to rise to it you know I mean I see you right yeah and I see
and that's it that's it and that's it and then when you do that
do you know how kids are specially you know like 12 and under and you tell them that and they just start walking around with their chest out on their
and that's one of the best things you can give a child
and then you let them explore and you and you tell them they are special which also means and we expect a lot of them so that was I'm going to pause you here okay
because this is if you look at the parenting research
this follow-up piece is
which is not your special
and you don't have to work at anything not your special and you don't have to do anything you're special and therefore therefore
I mean I was part of and I am like this with our kids and with you know I have baby nieces so I just left pieces they're my niece's children and when you turn into like your 20s and then you look at your parents and you're like these are all the things you did wrong right
and I remember saying to my mother
you never took my side
because
if I came home with any problem
and talk to my mother about it the first thing she would do was not oh honey come here let me hug you
oh honey let me take care of it the first thing she would do is look at you and say
what did you do
later
is that she was teaching me and us
reflect on what your agency was at that moment
and what was your responsibility and to the extent that you can
control it don't let things happen to you
okay I have to pause you again here because this is my nerdy research thing
emotion of possibility hope is actually
mostly taught by parents and a learned cognitive behavioral process what's interesting about it
is the positive correlation between hopefulness and a sense of agency
yeah yeah I see as you say that I see that yeah so hope is actually three this is CR Schneider's work out of Kansas hope is
goal I can set a goal pathway I can find a path to it that includes Plan B C D and E of plan a doesn't work
rent agency I believe in my ability to do it
play The Hope is the driver exactly about
let's talk about your agency here
in a way that also requires you
I think it's very important to also in any situation and certainly it's a rule for today among those who call themselves leaders
think about it in the context of reflection
because also requires reflection
what happened
what could have happened
what role did I play and what happened and what role did I play
it could be something where you should critically analyze it
or to know that that is the that there's a lesson learned right
I mean it's a Hallmark of courageous leadership it's a Hallmark of our leadership work is that your ability anytime you're giving corrective feedback or coaching
to anticipate you're going to have a part
right but that's exactly right
as a leader I'm very hard on myself
and one of the things that I feel and take very seriously is my responsibility to be
prepared
also I've got this little thing about it's really important to me to be on time to track someone tease me recently was worked with a lot of elected leaders and like I've never seen an elected leaders all the time but I feel
that I owe other people to respect of knowing your time is important right and it's the very least I can do is respect that
in terms of what they've had to do in their day to meet with me
what Dave had to put aside to do that
but there are these things that are about just what is your role in a moment
of responsibility
and also dut
and I gave a speech years ago
about the distinction that I see between
Duty and char
will I have a little extra to give and I will be a benevolent
and I will give you some of what I have
is the responsibility that you have is not an option know it is a responsibility you should not expect to be applauded for it because it is actually what you're supposed to do and I connect that to something I've seen my whole life and then most recently when I visited the aftermath of hurricane Helene
and I went to a lot of the relief centers and you've probably seen this houstonian
and what you've probably seen there and I've seen throughout my life
it is often the case that the people who have the least to give
give the most
100 the time right I mean we actually see that in the research on charitable giving right it's incredible
it's incredible
and that's what I mean about dut
it's not if you
I have two pennies I give you one
tell me it makes me
it just makes me emotional as somebody who's lived through
it takes me back to Harvey when the people getting us out of our home we're part of the Cajun Navy they were fishermen right yeah
Gator fan boats all kinds of stuff with all kinds of interesting to moms on them but they were they were putting us in those boats and so
being told look after your sister
put the toilet lid down are your you know sisters will die you get a pretty big sense of like wow every decision I make has pretty big consequences right okay I've got to ask you this question you get to Howard
I heard it was a houstonian
that term that created the term is it is it c ^ 3 was the name that I was given by my sorority when I joined the sorority we all had our nickname and that was mine and it stands for cool calm and collected so yes that was a very long time ago and that was the name I was given I had to track it back because I actually started the research on the short hair cut yeah oh you did yeah because someone sent it to me
in this moment of excitement about you running and said she had to listen to Depeche Mode look at the haircut we're going hard and I was like okay my husband loves Depeche Mode and I am not it's not my thing it's just so that's funny you say that but
I did have that shortcut but that was like those days it was those days but you know what you're right it wasn't the person who kind of managed our sorority when I joined was a houstonian
yes yes yes
okay first time you fell in love
oh goodness in high school did you did you get your heart broken or did you break someone's heart
I didn't get my heart broken I kind of just
you know Brothers also I mean
but my best friend from kindergarten is still one of my best friends know in fact she's been out campaigning for me in North Carolina knocking on doors let's go right
I love my girlfriends like I we have a Sisterhood like I have
my sister and in addition My Chosen sisters
who we have traveled life together right I am godmother to their children our husbands are like brothers right and it's a big part of my life
it's a big part of my life and it's a big part of
probably my sanity oh for sure right yes you know and in fact I tell women a mentor a lot of women and men
including our kids including
adult
know that again let's get back to agency know you have a choice
who will be in your friend Circle
and
those people who
are you going to root for you those people who are not going to judge you but at the same time we're going to say
girl you need a mint those who will laugh with you when you trip and fall and then they'll pull you back up and push you out
and and sometimes I just simplify this way cuz I did that a long time ago in my life
I'm not going to have mean friends
but you have to be you have to be intentional about these things
especially if you ever experienced I mean one of the things that we do with our kids is we do this little metaphor where we have them put a little like pretend there's a flame in their hand and say when you get really Bright and Shine make sure you don't hang out with anyone that comes by and blows it out because your lights too that's beautiful just like you want someone that says that's right and and we have to teach and including other adults you actually you have
the
to not have mean people in your life and to sit back and actually be intentional about
how do people make you feel and it doesn't mean that people are just blowing smoke that feels bad too actually does and it will not take you to a good place no right and there's no trust in that no but there's not and there's no safety in that either right
how someone treats you says more about you than them how you allow them to treat you as more about you
adult friendships
that's good work it's work that can be joyful
an important yeah it can be hard but
the most important people in my life identical twins
when my parents brought them home in New Orleans I was like
holy crap are both of them Staind like this is a little bit late period only on occasion and only once and usually around like Thanksgiving dinner I just wanted to go this way and I said what did you want Ashley said I just wanted you to talk to me what to do mostly I was like
well you and I have had that experience of our mother's passing and and what
and during an illness what that does right cuz it's interesting the relationship between adults siblings in the context of your parents
can have the effect of having you revert to your 12 year old self oh my God I mean all the sudden right like Scooby-Doo is on and the world but you are just back to me it's not pretty they push the buttons because they install them you know that's good because I have a question for you so
we've been studying like courageous leadership during leadership for 15 years we have found that daring leaders often have one or two values that are core to them and we all have a lot of values but one or two that are core where every other value is forged what would you say as a leader that your primary one or two values
how would you identify them
yeah they're probably directly connected
fairness and justice
that's really really important to me and Justice I mean I have
I mean I it is it prompts me to act if I if
see something that is
unjust or unfair
and at the same time fighting for that for others is something that is a real motivator of mine and actually will you know cause me to have a very almost emotional
feeling about the importance of
fairness and justice
okay another leadership question
I've been watching you
you're making a funny joke and it's interesting I see in you
there's a generational difference in leadership so folks who are
1015 20 years older than us come from a brand of leadership that is very command and control
it's somewhat ego protective and our generation is kind of caught in between that and
highly collaborative
right highly Coalition building absolutely
and in the best moments
surrounding ourselves by experts
who are high performers have deep knowledge and understanding and great strategy skills
you seem to move toward Coalition and collaborative leadership is that a fair assessment
my lived experience is to know that the vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us and Okay so
I love you then like a Venn diagram with conflict pull out a Venn diagram and it was one of her first and she's trying to pull out the Venn diagram about 11:30 and I was like okay we're going to figure out where is the intersection and then let's figure out where you're going to fit into it I literally still have this Venn diagram
but I just think that if we work toward
Coalition building we are stronger as a society I just know it and I know that when you bring together
seemingly different people
and you bring people around a table you can watch
the silos breakdown
and everyone leaves a bit tall
evolving in some ways devolving
people are feeling alone
and when you feel alone it's very disempowering
when we can bring people together
and they see the commonality it is then empowering of the individual
as well as what it does for the collect that's right that's right yeah I mean that's
that's actually the secret sauce of high-performing teams and it doesn't matter whether I'm working with a corporate team and NGO team a military special that that is you're not alone and
we are more like than we're different
I have to say something now cuz I'm getting I'm trying to win the over-under on not cussing during the podcast but okay I have to say this what you're describing is very different than what I saw from the previous Trump Administration and certainly a start difference in what he's committing to do in the next 4 years if he's president and I want to talk about something really specific and this is very difficult for me just as a woman as a person but also someone who is study leadership for decades
he's talking about loyalists not experts in positions of authority
people that will serve him
not our country
including most recently a comment
about using the military against Americans who disagree with him
the anime was in he talks about the Enemy Within
American citizens
I have to understand or I want to understand I don't have to understand but I want to understand
if I were working in an organization of Fortune 100 company
and I saw a leader surrounding
himself or herself with loyalists who serve
a person
rather than a mission and a purpose and shareholders are aboard that would last 5 Seconds
do you think this fear about
putting loyalists in place
is it is a real fear it is a very real fear
and we have heard
look the people who know Donald Trump best who worked with him
members of his political party
who worked with him inside the Oval Office inside the Situation Room
who were his chief of staff most recently the one who spoke out of four star Marine General
his National Security advisor two secretaries of defense and his former vice president
have all said he is unfit
to serve as president and he is dangerous
Donald Trump is someone who has said he would terminate the Constitution of the United States
I have taken the o
to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States six times
twice as de twice as Attorney General of the United States Senator announced vice president
they are very few
you know when do you say you make to your spouse to God but to the Constitution of the United States
is the highest dut
the most sacred
did any office holders specially president of the United States
and this man says he would terminate the Constitution of the United States
I'm talking about enemies within I mean that Harkens back to like McCarthyism know yeah I mean it's like a straight line it's a short line it's a short walk
and and
the fear
is real and legitimate and very well founded but what I urge everyone to do is
do something with that fear which is understand that
as long as we hold on to it have a democracy
and in a democracy in our country the people have the power through their vote
to determine
who will be their leaders and who will be president of the United States and the direction of our country right now we are truly at an inflection point
we are truly at an inflection point
authoritarian rule does not come
into power
with 1950s grainy black and white movies of Tanks rolling in organs being held to people's heads
in almost I mean if you look at hungry if you look at that I mean like what's happening is we vote someone in
and so this yeah the Enemy Within

can I run something by you
it's it's a theory that I have about what's going on what I see going on and I see it from a different perspective than probably political cuz I study human behavior and emotion
I actually get the attraction of the Trump Vance approach and I'm going to tell you why I get it
I get it because
we are not neurobiological hardwired for uncertainty Antonio damasio is a neuroscientist he always said don't ever believe that we're thinking machines
