everybody just wrapped up once again the biggest interview my entire life with number 45 in his own building president Trump talk a lot about the Afghan withdrawal talked a lot about China talked a lot about what's wrong with the country please like comment and subscribe share this with everyone you know much love from SRS enjoy the show Mr President Trump
it's an honor to be here in Vegas to interview you and so you need no introduction but I'm here is a US veteran I served in SEAL Teams and is the CIA contractor and I just want to talk to you about some of the most concerning topics when it comes to the the combat veteran population
good and so I'd like to start with
some rhetoric that's been in the news lately I don't believe it and there's been multiple times where the media is misconstrued some of the things that you say about veterans the latest being
supposedly you calling
veteran wounded veterans should have been shot or wound
suckers and losers
made-up story was made up by a magazine
and I think it was the Atlantic which is a radical left magazine
and as soon as I heard it I said that's
play a terrible thing and you don't get rid of it you know they make these things and they just use it and use it the opposing side they know it's false I had 26 people that said that never happened
who would
a stupid person or a person that's mentally ill
and you know as you know better than anybody I rebuilt our military
we gave 86,000,085 billion over the way to Afghanistan so stupidly but far bigger than even that I rebuilt our military
I had the best relationship with the military of any president
and respect the military more than anybody
and they just made up this horrible
I was
in his massive rainstorm
and I supposed to take helicopters to a certain place in Paris a little complicated I don't want to be too complicated
and the helicopters weren't able to fly the military helicopters our helicopters
and I looked at it I said
not going to be able to fly so I wanted to drive
by the time we
realize we had to drive it was very
and everybody talked me out of going and all of a sudden and it was a mistake I wanted to go and
somebody made up the story that I said that
and I have so many witnesses I have one of them in this room right now he's a witness that I never said it nobody would say that
and I went to one the following day in a big Cemetery
but they said I said about soldiers I think it was World War I soldiers
the suckers and losers and they're
GR
think of it they gave their life for our country
this was
Paris it was an American cemetery
and they said
and this was somebody
that actually he didn't say they made it up with a magazine they make things up they don't even have sources
they make things up out of thin blue like a storytel
and I wanted you to ask me this question
because
I think it's a terrible terrible thing
but they make up
and then one guy who's a very son of a low-life guy he is a low
they got one confirmation
and 26 people said it never happened
Buffalo the one confirmation was the guy that I fired
a terrible stupid person actually that couldn't do the job well
and I fire
any sort of confirmed it I don't know how he confirmed it but he did
it's a totally false story nobody could say nobody would say that and I would say this to military people
I'm the president of the United States I say suckers and losers they gave their
it's just a a disgraceful
storage on and
all I do is deny it we have so many witnesses
I said you know that's one of those questions where no matter how you answer
you lose you understand that I do I can sit here and talk about it for another 20 minutes
and at the end people would even if they have a doubt you've lost just a little doubt they need only need a 2% doubt
I would think that if people heard that I think if I heard that maybe I believe it if I was in the military you know what do they know they're sitting there and they heard the story
put out by this real rag that's failing badly losing a lot of money
and you know it's interesting I was doing a rally and
I was walking past press and some guy shouted to me I think from the mag
is it true you called them suckers and lizards
military in the graves
now that's a loser because as soon as I heard it I said
that you can't respond to
because no matter how vigorously you deny
I mean they have an expression for it I won't use the expression but it's a bad expression it's when they ask you a question that no matter how you answer
it leaves a Telltale St
and it's a shame that they can get away with it and we have libel laws now where you can do anything you can sue you can spend 25 million suing people
and they laugh at
it's a disgrace shouldn't be allowed but it is allowed since we're on a long form podcast and we're not going to take anything out of context or is there anything that you would like the veteran population to know about what you think of them that I love them that I respect them that I rebuilt our military that I got budgets that nobody's ever gotten that I increase their pay because of the respect I have
if you take a look at what's happening with the military
it's horrible under Biden
this this woman this woman is a
she's a communist I guess I mean and I look at action I don't look at words
Define the police who is the head of defund the police now all of a sudden she wants to you know deny it
she was for On The Border she was the Border
and millions of people poured into our country
add different prisons and they're from jails they're from mental institutions and insane asylums are all different you know
that's the mental institution on steroids as you know
and they're from in the terrorist
in many countries
recently
they came in from the Congo in Africa
where do you come from I think 22 people
but many more than
they're acting like their jails into a country they said where do you come from
Chicago where in the Congo jail
what did you do
they wouldn't
we have the toughest people in the world being dropped into a country and not from just South America from South America yes
venezuel
the crime rates down 72%
their prison population is way down their mental institution population is way down to this is true with many countries and that's because they're dumping their prisoners
did dumping their gang members MS-13 that dumping everybody into our country we have a totally open border
and she's a Marxist she's really a Marxist her father was is a Marxist professor
this woman
ran against I guess about 22 Democrats
she was the first to leave the rice
she left the race before she even got to Iowa the
primary State as you
a lot of people followed and Biden which is shocking because he's terrible
terrible for the military by the way but he's the worst president in the history of our country in my opinion
and yet what happened to him shouldn't happen he got 14 million vote she got no vot
it was a coup it was an overthrow of a president there's never been anything like that
that doesn't mean he's good or he's copied it but he did win
and then they said we don't want you you know we had a debate
and after the debate he was 17 points down in polls
and they went to him they said you're not going to win you can't win
and we want to get somebody else
and he didn't want to go and he fought it and then they said I think they're going to pull out the 25th Amendment
which is mental acuity
or something
and he said I'll go now they're trying to act like it was a friend it wasn't friendly he's a bitter man right now
what happened to him
you go through primaries you win I mean you won against 22 people and I think he got very lucky
things happened I understand exactly what happened but he got lucky but it doesn't matter he won
getting 14 think of it he got 14 million but she got none she never made it
to the
contest which is Iowa
and now she's running
okay now I'm not complaining because she should be easy to
this country is not ready for a Marxist or a communist this country is not ready for somebody that wants to defund the police
that said that they will never be fracking in our country if we don't Frack if we don't drill for oil and gas
we won't have a country because that's where the power comes from that's you know we can talk about all sorts of things but
that's the power that powers up our plans
I'd like to
I'd like to talk about the power grid but I like to start with one of the major concerns in the veteran Community is the way that the Afghanistan withdrawal happened we had 13 service members killed one missing an arm and his leg 7.1 billion in equipment left behind
allies in Afghanistan have been abandoned people that we fought alongside with for 20 years we left the intelligence
hit our bases
depict where they live Biometrics everything taliban's hunting them down killing them raping their wives raping their kids
we evacuated 120,000 +
Afghans that are unvetted we have no idea where they're at in our country and now we're sending them 40 to 87 million dollars a week
it's so bad
do we actually
I did an interview with Ahmad Masood he's the leader of the Afghan resistance
we wanted to get in front of Congress to warn us about
the oncoming threat that we're facing because we're funding the Taliban we had made a petition it now has almost 300,000 signatures
we got it to representative McCall
he's done nothing
not one
why do you think
Congress doesn't want to see m
well I'm surprised when you say McCall is a good man
but I was so against that whole thing you know just so you know
I wanted to get out but I want to get out with dignity and strength I spoke to the head of the Taliban
what numerous occasions
because they were killing our soldiers
they were snipers
and they were killing our soldiers
during Obama
add a little bit during me at the beginning
and I heard about
and I should get the head of the Taliban in the Press went crazy when they hurt I was speaking to on the telephone
and I told him
well pretty tough
nice
he's still there he's still
fashion don't
and he understood
and in 18 months not one person was killed you know that during my time
nobody would have been
tell me how to rigged election
and they took over
started in a lot of places Russia started to form
along the
would it never happened if I was president
but with the and by the way October 7th would have never happened in Israel because Iran was broke
did no money to do anything now they have 300 billion they made it all in the last three and a half
I said anybody that buys from I just wanted to have a deal with the
very simple deal can't have a nuclear weapon that's
I want them to be happy I want them to have great lives I want him to have a great country can't have a nuclear weapon
very simple and I would have had that deal done within a week after the election but the election was a disgrace to our country another disgrace how but but with with Afghanistan
you had to get out
but we were going to get out with dignity and
we're going to take our people out our Americans that we have people living there you said better than anybody could say it
when you said raping the wives raping the people
I mean I assume that could be happening but can you imagine we didn't take him
the military ran out first it's almost like
they ran we didn't remember this we didn't have
problem for 18 months with them in the taliban's rough they're good Fighters
their ancient fighters in a way their equipment and everything else but they're good very good fight
but we had no problems
and then when this happened and when I was
they heard that the military was gone
and I could just imagine somebody coming back and saying Abdul Abdul the Americans have
the soldiers are
he probably said you
don't ever tell me that that nobody could be so stupid
put Millie was a stupid person very stupid but you know we have great generals but Millie was stupid
guys like John Kelly are one of the he's one of the dumbest people I've ever met
a bully but a weak bull
and you know we just have some stupid people
Kelly wasn't so involved in
we have
really stupid people at
a little bit lower down the non television generals are phenomenal I beat the you know I took it 100% of the Isis CallApp
it was supposed to take 5 years I did it
3 weeks
and we have great generals and we have great military and they're not working you know the people that are welcome that people the top people they should all get out
and I'll tell you another thing I fired a lot of people
when they don't do a good job by fire
I think it's important
Biden's never fired anybody she's never fired anybody
everybody involved in that horrible most embarrassing day you understand that I think it's the most embarrassing day in the history of our country
that's what I did and it gave president she of China the right to fly bombers all over Taiwan you know what she's doing I mean it's just a question of time
although I get in I think it's a different story
but it gave him
the right to do things that he never did with me he never was flying the other day they flew 38 bombers over to one they have the surrounded by ships and there's a lot of bad things are happening there but
whoever worked on Afghanistan
should be fired the general should all be fire
that was the most incompetent thing they left first and they left Bagram one of the biggest air bases in the world you probably know that your military guy
what's the most powerful runways like 9 ft thick and you know
can handle the biggest loads of cargo and everything
put more importantly its 1 hour from where
China makes its nuclear weapons
and we gave it up just walked away just left the lights on walked away they left the dogs too by the way you know a lot of people say what about their dogs and a lot of dogs
the German Shepherds special dogs they left them all they left them or you can tell them doesn't like dogs by the way
but they left the dogs
they left the lights on
there's no reason to leave but they did we did want to get out but we want to keep I want to keep I
and I was set to get out it was enough already I was going to take all the equipment first of all I was going to get the Americans out then I would have gotten some of the people that helped us but you don't want to go crazy with that
and then you know the interpreters Etc
you know the people that got on those planes that was like survival of the fittest the toughest people got on the plane
enemies of ours in many cases and they got on those plans and many of the people got on those planes but they didn't get inside they were on the outside and they fell off the plane at 3,000
which is like three times the height of the Empire State Building
they fell off the plane those scenes of those planes taking
way up in the are going at 400 miles an hour
the people falling off the plain
they don't talk about that
they don't talk about the border and just
bring you up-to-date today was learned that 818,000 jobs
did they said were produced we're not produced
they don't talk about that yesterday it was
reveal 2 days ago it was revealed that Joe Biden
and the family stole 27 million
can you imagine if Trump stole 27 million or two dollars
they would have stopped everything they would have stopped the Democratic Convention they said let's make it next
Biden it was revealed by Congress by committees in Congress I think three committees
confirm 27 million dollars by the family of something having to do with
and you don't hear about it I don't I didn't see any stories about it I saw a little piece on Fox
put outside of that I didn't read one story about can you imagine
they confirmed the 27 million dollars the night that he made the speech
which was a very nasty spee
the hatred he
the people that overthrew him isn't overthrows it was a
he screams everything is
he's like screaming all the time
it's like very uncomfortable
but I understand his screaming is that she's got a disorder
Nancy Pelosi
Barack Hussein Obama
and a group of people went to them they said we're going to
you need to get out I'm going
wheel in the 25th Amendment
what did you think when you got that
I said that he was leaving that he was leaving did you know he was going well there's a lot of speculation
contact with him was during the debate
and the debate was very early if you remember cuz he didn't even really have the nomination yet or you know so
I didn't care I gave up everything I said they gave me a thing they really didn't want to debate they gave me CNN
they gave me
Dana Bash
they gave me who's the internet exactly my best friend
and they gave me
what I used to call fake Tapper but I don't call them fake anymore because I thought they were very fair both of them were very fair during the debate but but they gave me two people that I would never take they gave me a network that I would never take a cable station CN
they said we'd like you were both sit down I said let's stand up okay I was able that's the only point I
and they gave me
all of these are they said there's no audience I'd rather have an AUD
but they say there's no audience and they say we're going to cut your mic off after
so they gave me everything
and I thought I'd reject it I said I'll take
cuz it was the only way I could debate
they were surprised I took
but they still had to go forward with it and we went forward
I wouldn't say he performed brilliantly this was not Winston Church
and he was very white you know he wore a very white makeup I don't know what happened I don't think his makeup artist did a great job actually I walked in I said man I see
but but he didn't perform too well
that's where it started with him you know there was no chance of that happening before that yeah even though I didn't think it was exactly sharp it wasn't The Brightest Bulb in the ceiling is the expression go
that's when it started and then he did a series of interviews to show that he's actually okay and they were real set up interviews George Lopez from ABC ABC's the worst of the group by the way you know they're doing the debate they were going to do the Deb
I made a deal with fox
and ABC and also NBC
he's turned down Foxy's turn down NBC he'll only do ABC ABC is actually the worst of the group
believe it or not
the nastiest
if you're in my line of work which can be a very dangerous line of work by the way I was telling the people at the border they said
there are some people out there that are pretty rough on the border and I said I think so
but I said to him you
it's actually very dangerous being the president sexually pretty dangerous line of work if you
just look at the
number of people
didn't exactly make it the proportion
is very much higher than race car drivers or
15 *
but it's I said it's a dangerous line of work but you have to do it
and you have to do it properly they're saying that you sure you want to be here
I say I have an obligation to be here the borders are very unsafe place
and we have to straighten out the border the borders
who is this Kam
never went to the Border she went to a border that you would take your family and
essentially never went to the Border she was the borders or she was the worst borders are in the history of the world there was never a border so bad as this one
I'd like to go to Russia Ukraine that's a major concern of a lot of Americans have sent over 175 billion dollars we've seen no progress
and so I think a lot of people want to know
when you get into office if you get into office
will you be able to set Selinsky in Putin down and have them negotiate a deal so that we can spend the next $175 billion dollars on our own infrastructure
so let me tell
two count
should have never happened would have never ever happened didn't happen for 4 years there was no talk about Russia going
I knew Putin very well I got along with him actually
and that's a good thing Not a Bad Thing by the way you know people say oh you got along with what the stupid press
some of the stupid friends some of the press is not stupid at all
that's a good thing
he's got 1800 nuclear weapons
show
the biggest risk today I don't want to hear these poor fools talking about
global warming they don't go out that anymore they call it climate change because you know some parts of the planet the cooling and call me it didn't
so they finally got it right they call
they just
climate change they used to go to global war
you know years ago they used to call global cooling in the 1920s I thought the planet was going to freeze now they think the plan is going to burn
and we're still waiting for the 12 years you know we're down almost to the end of the 12-year period you understand that with
lunatics that know nothing they weren't even good students at
they didn't even
they predict they said that we have 12 years to live and people didn't have babies because they said
we only have another no no it's so crazy but the problem
isn't the fact that the oceans and 500 years will raise a quarter of an
the problem is nuclear weapons its nuclear
the level of power of the nuclear weapon today
you take a look go back many many decades and
hirosh
nagas
that was so many years ago
and now you look at today and multiply that
what took place there
300 400
the biggest risk is that always that always that
but we also have some very bad people you know you have crazy Nancy Pelosi and all these lunatics within our government their lynott
add and it's a real problem
the biggest problem we have
and the world has is Weaponry Weaponry of other kinds to not just nucle
what kind of weather is so massive and so powerful and so destructive
Andy's poor fools talk about global warming all the time
you know the planet's going to get
it's going to Global warm to a point where
the oceans will rise in 8th of an inch and 355 years you know they have no idea what's going to happen to the weather
in the meantime we're spending our wealth on this
what would we have we have people Sean
nuclear capability now you have five countries
would nuclear capability that is so devastating it would be obliteration
what would you like to see happen with Russia Ukraine how would you like to see that deal go down we would have never happened
it didn't happen you know a lot of people say well how do we know actually Democrats even say that wouldn't have happened October 7th Israel wouldn't have happened but
I've told people
no Putin very well
I told him don't do it it was the apple of his eye we were talking a lot
and Ukraine was the apple of his eye I said don't do it don't do
I will go exactly what I said in terms of why you can't do it but you can't do it and he wouldn't have done it he wouldn't have done it
but when he saw in Afghanistan
I think that's when he really said this is a time that he can go in and I was
by this time I was
but when he saw Afghanistan
I think that changes whole thinking toward
he lost
for the United
he also has no respect for
who does
show Putin
zielinski
was involved in the
impeachment hoax number one that was a couple of hoe
which I won both of
but he was very honorable
I made a very innocent phone call to him to congratulate him on
one of the people that work for me not the brightest
asking me to call zielinski call zielinski call please call him and congratulations cuz they wanted to do an oil deal or something I said call him and you know for the United States
and call them and congratulations kept asking me I finally I call
and they took that call which was a congratulatory
and they made it into an impeach
and I will say I got great support from the Republicans and the Republicans really in Congress I think
I got $196 out of 196
when did you ever hear that about the Republicans right you know how great support Jim Jordan and all these guys that were
so it was wiped out
but I got to know zelinsky then because
add a news conference or something
did President Trump say anything that was
threatening to you or bad this was the reason you got a picture can you believe
