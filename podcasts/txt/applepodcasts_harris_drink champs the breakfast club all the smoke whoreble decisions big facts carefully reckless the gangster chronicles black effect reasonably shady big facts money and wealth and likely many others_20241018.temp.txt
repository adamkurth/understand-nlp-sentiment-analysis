hasn't Maya Rudolph and wonderful I think I have nothing for
for the comedy and I think
it's important to be able to laugh at yourself in each other in the spirit of obviously comedy and not belittling people as my
what do you say to people who say you stay on
I would say you're welcome
I mean listen here's the
I love having conversations which is why I'm so happy to be with you this afternoon
and the reality is that there are certain things that must be repeated to ensure that
I have everyone know what I stand for and the issues that I think
and so it requires repetition you know some people say that
until someone has heard the same thing at least three
it just doesn't stay with you
what's a repetition is
and for that reason yes at my rallies I say the same thing when I go to Detroit as I do in Philly as I do wherever I am
to make sure that people hear and and
what I think of some of the most critical issues that are at stake
there has to be a high level of anxiety too when you have these conversations though cuz you are running for
I mean you know what there is certainly a lot of I feel the
of the moment and my
I feel an extraordinary
weight of responsibility right now
to do everything I can I'm telling you Charlemagne when I go to bed at night
I almost every
in addition to my pray
I have I done everything
a margin of ER
I'm going to
but
and you know what is that steak is truly
profound and and historics
and it's about you know some people would say this lofty notion of
reporting and preserving our democracy
but it is about
issues that affect people everyday
whether we're going to maintain a 351 insulin for our seniors whether we're going to continue to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices to bring them down whether we are going to have as my opponent would have a formalized stop and frisk policy
for which he has said if a police department does not do it they should be defunded
there is so much at stake whether America is going to stand on its principles around the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity and stand with our allies around the world or whether we're going to admire dictators and send during the height of covid in the pandemic
covid test that nobody could
to the president of Russia for his personal use when black people were dying every day by the hundreds during
yeah I feel like that one that one has gone over people's heads the fact that he was sending covid test
I mean you know I invite I
your listeners the people we know the number
who lost their Grande
remember what that was like during the height of covid and a lot of it people
scrambling for the resources in
and Donald Trump during that time
set covid test to the president of Russia who by the way do not
in the 2016 election cuz I was a member of the Senate intelligence committee when we
when we investigated
targeted black vot
in 2016 with Miss and disinformation
to discourage black people from voting in
and and this
just another of the very many examples of who Donald Trump really is yes
misinformation and one of the biggest
pieces of misinformation one of the biggest allegations against you is that you targeted and locked up thousands of black
in San Francisco for weed something say you did it to boost your career some say you did it out of pure hate for black men please tell us the facts what's the
who around those days will tell you I was the most progress
prosecutor in California on
marijuana
and would not send people to jail for simple possession of
and as vice president
have been a champion for bringing marijuana down on the schedule so instead of it being ranked up there with her
we bring it down and my pledges as president
I will work on decriminalizing it because I
exactly how those laws have been used to disproportionately impact
certain populations and specifically black men
before we get into the TalkBack feature and take some questions from the audience I do want to talk to you about the legalization of weed because you're saying you want to legalize it now what steps did the Biden Administration take to get closer to
we had to work with the DEA and
there's a certain level of bureaucracy that exists in the federal government that
slows things down but essentially
to bring down
how weed is classified how marijuana is classified
to make it classified as a lesser harm and so that took some time there's a whole process around that but that's the work that we have done
in addition to work that we have done writ large on Criminal Just
okay let's take some
let's go to the TalkBack feature
why are we and I say we because my tax
is sending the money
why are we spending money to other countries will we just need in our own country for home
resources for whatever
that is my determining Factor if I vote for common or
that's that's one of the reasons the America First rhetoric resonates cuz nobody in America would complain about when money was going if American citizens everyday needs were being met so what
we can do it all and we
so first of all
I maintain very strongly America should never pull ourselves away
for my responsibility as a world
that is in the best interests of our national security in each one of us as
and are standing in the world
that being said we also have an obligation to American citizens obviously and people who are here to meet their everyday needs
which is why for example we have done the work
in the last 4 years of Bringing Down the cost of prescription medication whether it be $35 a month for seniors for insulin or $2,000 a year
on prescription medic
what we have done that has been about putting 17 billion in our hbcus I am proud to be the first HBCU vice president United States I intend to be the first HBCU president of the United States
those resources are about sending them to centers of academic Excellence that I know them to be
the work that I continue to do is about increasing access to
for our small business
it is about increasing the opportunity for homeownership knowing that black people are 40% less likely to be homeowners in America we have a history
of
and and and and procedural obstacles to that home ownership starting with the fact nobody got 40 acres and a
to redlining to issues
this Detroit area and people around the country know to be real
so part of my plan is that we're going to give people a 25,000 down payment assistance to get their foot in the door
to buy a home for first-time home
the work that I'm going to do to increase housing Supply in America knowing that that's one of the reasons that rents and
prices of Jack
and to work with the private sector cut through the red
and work to build more housing 3 million before the end of my first
and I give these examples and there are many more which I will offer so for example
the work that I will do to extend the child tax credit to $6,000
for young families during the first year of their child's life cuz as you and I both know
our families all have a natural desire to parent their children well
bernardo's resources
so bye expanding the child tax credit to the first day of child's life to thousand dollars that gives that young family the ability to buy a car seat or a crib
close the things that are so important during that critical phase of that child's development
so that they can get on the road and actually have a chance
you know you said we can do it all but can we you know Tupac famously said you know we got money for
what
feed the poor right and I saw President Obama say last week that you know you really shouldn't expect
you know a
to rid the world of all of
so is it fair to tell people hey we can do it all cuz that's when people get disappointed when things don't
but I I think President Obama is absolutely correct but it doesn't mean we can't do
so when I talk about extending the child tax credit as I when I was vice president I push that we would do it during our first year
and we reduced black child poverty in America by 50%
we did that
we can do that
my plan that is about building up home ownership in the black
we can do that
my work that has been about increasing access to Capital bringing billions more dollars into our Community Banks which I've done
through cooperation and partnership with some of the big Banks and Tech
to get more access to capital for our entrepreneurs for our
we've done
we should never sit back and say okay I'm not going to
because everything hasn't been solved I share a desire
I think it is what we should all
but that doesn't that shouldn't stand in the way of us also known we can participate in
what about
and by voting in this
you have two
or
but you have two choices
and it's two very different
one mind that is about taking us forward and progress and investing the American people investing in their Ambitions dealing with their
and the other Donald Trump is about taking us back
that is about
why can't we
yes we can say that Reverend Solomon kinloch Junior I want you to meet him he is the senior pastor of Triumph Church with Reverend
what's up Reverend by the Vice President Charlemagne thank you all for being in Detroit tonight
recently a Madam vice president
buy one of
surrogates from the black faith based
you've been criticized by him and
for your lack of Eng
to the black
knowing that the black
an un
a place in the
black
what could you speak to as it relates to a future
a Harris Administration how you would partner with the black
to address some of the urgent
of the black community Dr King talked about the fierce urgency of right now and as a church Triumph churches in that
so first of all
that allegation of courses
team because they are full of
me from the people I have worked with and
that I am
so that they can try and have some advantage in this election cuz otherwise they have nothing
I grew up in
I grew up I grew up
attending 23rd Avenue Church of God in Oakland California
yes that is
my pastor is Amos Lee Brown of 3rd Baptist Church in San Francisco California
I have throughout my career and as vice president and Rec
actively Eng
church and church
not only so we can share
but so we can share in what we can do together that is about supporting the community the stren
Community the cohesion
and it is my long-standing work and therefore my pledge going forward
I will always
because I understand who our church leaders are and who the Cong
we are talking about people who are driven by
and the ability to see what is possible
by faith where I was raised and I know many of us
understanding that our God is a loving
that are Faith propels
to act in a way that is about kindness and justice
that is about lifting one another
and let's talk about the contrast here
Donald Trump and his follow
spend full time trying to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat
which is absolutely contrary to the church I
where are church and my
is about saying true leadership
the measure of that is based on who you lift
and then he selling $60 Bible
or tennis shoes
trying to play people as though that makes him more understanding of the black community come on
thank you for the correct thank you and God is good
did you want to do anything specifically for black people have you seen
what is a clip that has you saying that you're not going to do anything specific
you said it at the beginning of this visit Charles
one of the biggest challenges that I face is
and it's
because it is meant to
convince people that they somehow
should not believe that the work that I have done
has has occurred and has
my
the beginning of my career through today
has been about for example we've talked about it whether it be
hbcus whether it be on Healthcare black maternal mortality I am singularly many would say
one of the highest level leaders in our country to bring the initial black maternal mortality to the stage of the white
the work that I've done that has been about
focusing on my knowledge and my experience in my life experience of knowing
the entrepreneurship that we have in the community the ambition the aspirations the dreams and then tapping into that so that not only is my work been about
ensuring that we have some of the lowest black unemployment ever
in our country
but that also knowing that that should be a baseline that everybody has a job
and what we should be invested in is also Building Wealth in the community and intergenerational
and I have many many examples of that
but again part of the challenge that I
is
they are trying to
scare people away
because they know they otherwise have nothing to run on ask Donald Trump what his plan is for
project 2025
the plan includes
Macon police departments have stopped and frizz
the plan in
making it more difficult for workers to receive overtime
the plan includes ending the ability of Medicare to negotiate drug prices you know what we have done he said he would we did
which means that that's how we brought down the cost of prescription medic
his plan includes
making it more difficult for working people to get
and to destroy
our democracy you know what he says he'll do terminate the Constitution of the United States let me remind
you know what's in the Constitution of the United States the Fourth Amendment
which protects you against unreasonable searches and seizures
the Fifth Amendment the 6th amendment the 14th Amendment and he's going to terminate the Constitution of the United States
which in most of those amendments one thing or another was about a movement video by James Patterson detective cross you've been doing this a long time and you're the best and created by Ben Watson's serial killer

let's take a question from
hi my name is Joshua Fisher age 31 years old African-American male from Las Vegas Nevada I'd like to ask Madam vice president what laws does she have planned to make sure that there's a stop to police brutality and murders that have been going on
so again the work that I have done through my career and the most recently even when I was in the United States Senate to help write the
Floyd Justice in policing Act
Cory Booker and I work very closely on that could you tell people that didn't pass to get folks a quick
we couldn't get the votes
there's a clip somewhere of me
with
a republican Center ES
right to
but what we did when we came in office and during the time that I've been vice president is
pass an executive order
where is we were trying and I have been trying to make these things National so that everyone would have to do it
an executive order by the president in our Administration says that for federal
the following things have to happen which we for the first time
no no
Barn
a National Database notes for federal law enforcement but a National Database
for us to collect information
police officers who have broken the law and this is no small issue this piece in addition to everything else
because as we know we've seen plenty of examples
a police officer who committed misconduct in wondrous diction and then goes to another jurisdiction and gets hired because there's no
there's no place that's tracking their their
so these are the some of the things that we've done and then listen I'm still going to always work on getting the judge George Floyd Justice in Pollack
part of the work that I'm doing as a candidate for president United States includes lifting up
those candidates who are running either for re-election or for the first time
to Congress
who are supportive of what we need to do on all of the issues we
whether it be
freedom to
in passing the John Lewis voting rights advance
whether it be freedom to make decisions about your own body
whether it be the freedom to just be and be free from any brutality including police brutality when and
I think a lot of the frustration comes from
people who
will say sometimes politicians volunteer lies because you know yes it is great to try to pass the George Floyd police
you probably know you can't get the votes so I pushed that why do I push that on people now
I don't I don't subscribe to that approach and I'm going to tell you why
it took a long time for the Voting Rights Act to get
you know it took of the brutality of of what happened when when
Lewis and all those were trying to cross the Edmund Pettus
it took a lot of work over our history to do what we have accomplished
and we have to remain
how do you convince Republican
their constituents are part of this I mean we have plenty of folks who want this who live
were they serve and this is the point this gets back to the earlier point
can't let him by take you out of the game by
the the solutions and maybe this is the point you're making about what president
the solutions are not going to happen just overnight
and the solutions that we all want are not going to happen in totality because of one
but here's
the things that we want and are prepared to fight for won't happen if we're not act
and if we don't part
we cannot allow
circumstances to take us out the game because then basically what we're saying is all those people who are obstruction
we're standing in the way of change they're winning
cuz they're convincing
that it can't be done so take yourself out don't participate
look at that
look at that vicious circle
so let's not fall
