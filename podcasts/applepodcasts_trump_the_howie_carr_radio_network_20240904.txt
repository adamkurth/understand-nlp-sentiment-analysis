joining us now on the highway car show as former president Donald Trump and it's great to have you here with us Mr President and as you know your opponent the vice president Kamala Harris is in New Hampshire today she's she's in the Seacoast area speaking at a ball place is a recall throwback Brew
and she's talking about the tax incentives for small businesses would you like to react to her parents in in New Hampshire today
well what can you say she makes few appearances where she says anything
she reads off a script she's
doing interviews you wouldn't do your show I guarantee you that she won't do any shows and she sort of like playing the basement they played the basement with
and I tried to do the same thing but I think people are wise so she's a Marxist her father's a Marxist her father daughter
and that's what she is and she's changed every single program every policy that she's ever been involved in
and frankly nobody's ever seen it like that and if she ever became a president our country would be destroyed almost instantly would have a whole different country
and by somebody that has no right to even be thinking about doing that because
I don't think she's earned her strip
if you look at her career everything she's touched his certain bad San Francisco is not habitable
now and it was 15 years ago is the best city in the country
California is a disaster she was the Attorney General destroyed
you're allowed to go
Rob stores but anything please don't go over $950
and you won't be prosecuted the whole thing with her is so bad
and now she's gone to Mega she wants to go to Mecca she's coming out every day
where's that well maybe we will build the walls are wonderful
and maybe we will have a strong border and she's changed like 14 policies
and you know that and you've been with politicians a long time
what they first come out with is where they go she's a mar
not a good person
and it's a disgrace what she's doing to our country a
she's the nominee she never went to New Hampshire Joe Biden never went to New Hampshire during the primary they they they changed the date so the New Hampshire would no longer be the first in the nation primary and now she's coming up promising to throw money at small businesses is it going to work
well when I campaigned recently in New Hampshire and won the Primary easily
if you remember I used to say that will you please remember that they disrespected you
I always campaign with the Democrats and I was like everybody was passing each other they were
they went to South Carolina and other places and they
New Hampshire the dust and that's a big thing for New Hampshire you know being first has always been with Iowa and New Hampshire it was a
and that was a tendon for many many years and that was a big thing
you start Iowa and New Hampshire and they changed it
the Democrats change it and put you at
I should have in a sense at the bottom of the
and I only hope the people of New Hampshire remember it because
if I did it I did just the opposite I put you there I left you there and I made a strong statement but but I hope and I said this I hope the people of New Hampshire remember
what they did
because what they did was a real insult to New Hampshire
the debate now is 6 days away do you think Kamala Harris is really going to show up for the ABC Deb
what she's got a big advantage in ABC it's probably the worst news organization there is in terms of fairness
they have George flapper Doppler who's a disaster the
and they have others
we'll have to see with
the
I like he's a nice man a nice guy
but I think he's totally controlled by by the rest of
the management is radical
their management is very friendly with her you know the top person is best friends with her and her husband
so I think that's very unfair but
I also say you have to Deb
and I'm willing to do it but everybody's watching to see whether or not ABC can be fair they are absolutely worse than NBC which is almost impossible to be
they're worse than CBS certainly
I will say I was treated very fairly by CNN they really did treat me fairly I used to call him
I won't even say it I used to call him think I used to call Jake he treated me fairly and so did Dana Bash treat me fairly I think Dana hurt herself with that ridiculous interview of
comic is that was a total
what did you make what did you make of Carmela's southern accent that she used in Detroit on Labor Day and then how you know a few hours later when she got the Pittsburgh she went back to her normal
what's what's up with that I thought it was disgraceful actually I thought it
but I think what she does is bad
she is she wants to put our country out of business
she didn't want walls she didn't want anything I mean everything left
she she wants to get rid of your health insurance your private health insurance she wants to raise your taxes at
never seen before
she wants to terminate the Trump tax
those are the biggest tax cuts ever got and then she wants to terminate them if you terminate those
cuts that I got
taxes will go up by about four times
in our
it'll be the biggest just determination will mean the biggest tax
in the history of our country just determination so she wants to terminate the Trump tax cuts I think it would be
I mean a lot of people say it would lead to a depression in our country if she does
yeah 91% of the population would get the tax increase but now she's going up to New Hampshire today and said she's going to give you know handouts to a small businesses quote unquote tax and send it let me ask you about voter fraud
my my listeners remain very concerned despite all the lawsuits that the your campaign in the RNC have been filing can you reassure him that you're going to have it under control on an election day so we won't see a repeat of 2020
well look they should be concerned we have to swamp
they cheat like
they are cheaters and they always have that they've been for a long time in the last election was
a great example of it we did so well I got millions of more votes and millions and millions more votes than I did the first time did much better than the first time
and they use covid they rigged the election
and it's a disgrace but with all that being said I like too big to rig you know just get out and
we got to win it and then we got to change it around change the elections around because what's happening in this country you know you need walls meaning you need bord
get up
and we build hundreds of miles of water we established the best the single
immigration situation we've ever had meaning the most effective Southern border we've ever had in the history of our country
and you need that and you need
Fair
because if you don't have borders and if you don't have Fair election
you don't have a country
and we have
very very we are bad elections let's face it we have bad elections will like a third world country
and nobody's ever had a border like we had we had probably 20 million people coming over that border during their term and many of these people come from prisons and jails there's a slight difference I always explain there is a slight difference one is more severe than the other but prisons in jail
and mental institutions and insane as
and many terrorists are coming into a country at levels that we've never seen before
and now you see
in a different places like Aurora and Chicago
UCF Venezuelans and all of these migrants coming in
they're doing just as I said Trump was right about everything
they're taking over cities they're taking over Aurora they're taking over
cities with AK-47s have the
machine guns are the best weapons you've ever seen they have top military
Style
did taking over
it's it's just like I said it was going to be they Venezuela and other countries
many other countries and who wouldn't do it if I was leading a country I'd do it they took that criminals out of their country and bust them into the United States and dumped him here and said if you come back we're going to kill you
and we are living with all these criminals now
you know that
in Venezuela crime is down 72%
because they've taken their criminals they've emptied their jails by the way
they're not totally empty yet they're down
massive numbers but they will be very shortly
and taking all of their prisoners and dump them into the United States and we take it we are led by the worst stupidest people
in history and she leads it and she's a radical Marxist it's okay with her she's the one that back to all the crime that took place in Minnesota
I got them out on bail you know she got them out on bail and nothing happened to those people nothing happened but j6 it all happens right
the college students are back now and you've seen the anti-israel riots have already resumed that places like Columbia
the UK under the new socialist prime minister is cut off some arm shipments to is
what would what would you do right now to short Israel and defeat Hamas and Iran and in these in these riots on college campuses that seem to be starting up again
I'm sure you have to stop the riots you have to bring in the police in Oklahoma does he want to bring in the police
they're ripping the place apart
and they don't want to bring because it's his mark
theology is this Marxist the stuff that you read about with her she's a Marxist she wants that to happen
she's only you know using the small business today she's in New Hampshire talking about small business she knows nothing about small business
and she was there for Afghanistan decision which was the most embarrassing moment
in history and then when I went
at the request of the incredible
Patriots who lost their son and Sons and in the case in this case a daughter
but at their request I went to Arlington National Cemetery
and it was a tough thing to do because I was in an area which was made it very tough for me to get there and I got there on time and I spent time with them I know them from
from being with them they're incredible people they were horribly
treated and they were also what to happen to their children
their children were killed
they were
by Joe
I call her comrade Harris because that's what she is
I heard their children just as if they had a
because the incompetence of Afghanistan
was the killing of their children
and I went there
and we spent I spent a lot of time there I went to a ceremony and then I went down to the graves and they asked me if I take pictures with them and the families at the graves
would I stand alone with the grave and all of this
and I didn't have people with me I
small group of people had a lot of Secret Service
so I did this
can I get home that night
and I see that they put out there
VR
saying Donald Trump use the death of soldiers for publicity which is the last thing I did and I said I denied it and you know what those parents came out
unbelievable they said we we invited him
we invited
we love him he's the only one that was there for us etc etc
that they would do that was so nice I mean it was so nice
but we're dealing with bad people here
Pamela and and crooked Joe I call him crooked Joker who was never a more crooked president in our history
Biden said he worked tirelessly to free the hostages they put out a statement when he was on vacation on Monday he babbled that he had spoken to the dead American
do you think there's an actual chance that he would be removed by the Democrats so that she can run in the final weeks is the actual president I mean he's not in control
no well he only worked tirelessly to try and move his beach chair which is you know is about 6 oz so they can hardly lift
he can't lift his feet out of this and somebody convinced him that he looks good in a bathing suit and you know it's
he's sleeping on the beach
during the week
and he's sleeping he's dead cold
and I said you know if your president you don't want to be seen sleeping and you don't want to be on the beach and
and during the week we're not even talking weekend so he's there all the time
somebody has him convinced that this is a good look I don't think so I don't think so could you could you imagine president XI of China
who's the Workhorse by the way but could you imagine presidency of China sleeping unconscious like sleeping on a beach
during the week I don't think so
kjp yesterday at her news briefing she said that grocery prices are
grocery prices
have you noticed that Mr
grocery prices aren't down inflation is slowing
but the 4050 60%
is that everybody had to eat that's their
and that hasn't come down at all
in fact that's gone
and you know you look this is probably the worst inflation we've ever had in our country
and they're being helped by OPEC you know OPEC is helping them
the fuel because they want to have
call Biden back you know they they've taken advantage of
totally you know they want to have that
that group
but the Outback is helping them trying to keep
the energy cost at but we don't need anybody we have enough we have more Liquid Gold under our feet than any other Nation
including Saudi Arabia including Russia
but they're trying to help
get these people
because for a lot of other reasons Not Just Energy they take advantage of our country hor
you know what RFK Jr endorsed you and it was a it was a great speech that he made
he said in an interview that you would told him that you would release in in your next term the JFK assassination files and he also said that the light Pompeii
the Secretary of State talked you out of doing it in in 2020 is is that true that he that Mike Pompeo talk to you out of that and will you release the JFK assassination file
I will and will do it rather quickly there were other people Mike also for whatever reason but there were some other people also that didn't want to do it and I did release a lot you know I release I think half of it and I said rather than
having people in the administration that felt strongly about it I thought it was better not but I'll be releasing him and within the first week
of of the
position for for RFK I was talking to some people over the weekend and they said maybe he'd be a good Chief of Staff they just threw that out and better than a cabinet secretary if you discussed any specific post with
no but I would I'd love to have involved look he's a very unusual guy
and he's got some unusual views but perhaps very correct views I mean he's very big into the world of Health as you know that
pesticides and what you eat what you put in your body
and this is a very smart guy and and I find him and you have known him a long time this is not something new I've known him a long time and
I think I understand him as well as anybody can
and he's a different kind of a guy but he's a very good person
and I think that you know I would I would love to have them involve
but I haven't I haven't discussed anything specific I was very honored when he
when he did that you know they wanted him and they wanted him badly
they didn't want to say that but they wanted
Kennedy means a Democrat and maybe that's changing because nobody wants to go these These are no longer Democrats these are radical left fre
that we have in our government today these aren't Democrats they weaponized government
they have they put gag orders on me I'm a candidate how about that I'm a candidate and I want to answer questions but I'm not allowed to cuz I'm
by a judge who is just it's not even believable okay what's going on there it's not even believable but can you imagine they gag the Republican candidate and now as you see I'm leaving in the
the leading canned
the president has a gag order that I'm not allowed to talk about things where there's plenty to talk about
yeah Nate silver says this morning that you have a 56.7 percent chance of winning that's getting into Landslide territory if it were the popular vote you know I mean that you're the
you've got this sentencing date coming up on September 18th are you concerned about this what what do you say happening with this this nonsense in New York
it's a rigged court system
it's a disgrace what's going on you know that particular case
every single
legal scholar that you read about Mark Levin
McCarthy and Turley Jonathan Turley and every one of them
Jarrett was fantastic for Fox every single
Skylar including Rifkin and lots of other
said there is no case
at this judge
so that there would be a
by taking non-existent misdemeanors I mean what he did
nonexistent misdemeanors
that would have expired
years before
enter
it's so unbelievable the whole New York Court System
and I told my people I said that's because as you know we won the big case in Florida that was the one that they all talked about
and we had a brilliant brilliant I don't know the judge we had a brilliant judge who was strong
are they played the ref with her saying as many bad things as they could
and you know a lot of judges succumbed to that area
take a take a look I mean so many
those judges
succumb
you know you're not a good judge you're not moving fast you're not this oh they were playing the ref like you wouldn't believe
I run out of time I want to ask you one more thing that was there was another arrest of a red Chinese spy who worked for the Democrats yesterday this time it was a former aide to a governor Holcomb caught red-handed as the headline in the New York Post caught red-handed you know all of these all of these people Dianne Feinstein's driver Eric swalwell girlfriend the the Harvard Professor always what is it with the Democrats and taking money from the red Chinese
call Swallow was a beauty he had the Chinese girl that played him like a sucker and he's on like intelligence to the intelligence committee and crazy Nancy Pelosi refused to move him off and yet he's with a Chinese
who is a beautiful Chinese spy and she played him like a fiddle and then dumped him and the whole thing is crazy and they wouldn't take him off the intelligence committee or whatever committee it was a big one and now you have it I mean
they don't respect our country
are they take advantage of our country and I'm the only one that was wise to it I've charged them hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and taxes no other president got anything in fact so much at Biden wants to take the tariffs off them but they can't because there's so much money that comes in from the Trump tariff
and we are
if we get
I know this system better than anybody else we're going to have a country that's greater than ever before but if we're going to go through four more years of millions of people coming in
coming in from prisons and mental institutions and terrorists we're going to have another
4 years of that we will have a hundred more than a hundred million people
led into our country many of them are criminals many of them a big percentage of them are criminals they're destroying our country and we have to stop it and she wants it to go I don't know why because there's nothing good that can happen but she wants that to be
the case she wants open borders and that's what will happen she can say all she wants it she wants to close the borders she wants open borders and that's what that's what will happen we will have more than a hundred million people swamp our country and we're not going to have a country left your Social Security is going to be gone your Medicare is going to be gone your house is it going to be gone we're going to be in Venezuela on steroids that's exactly what
she wants for this country
that's the one part I can't figure out
Mr President thank you very much for being with us and you want to say a final few words to the people of New Hampshire today is Camilla Harris
she's a disaster she's a Marxist and we have to stop her from getting in there trying to slide her in the back door by having her not say anything she won't do interviews she wont do anything hopefully I have a very good debate and exposure for what she is she's no good she's ruined everything San Francisco California everything is ruined you can't even go back to those places vote for Trump we're going to make America great again
