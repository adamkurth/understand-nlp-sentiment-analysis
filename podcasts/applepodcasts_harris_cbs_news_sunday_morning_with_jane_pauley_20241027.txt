just nine days until election day no time to lose in a presidential race where every vote count
Norah O'Donnell is on the campaign trail with candidate Kamala Harris
I'm not here as a celebrity I'm not here as a politician I'm here as a mother Beyonce's song Freedom has become Kamala Harris's Anthem and that was the message in Houston Friday night so on this most extraordinary decisions comma 30000 people braved 90Â° heat the Attorney General United States government to hear her scoring rules Donald Trump won't let anyone see his medical records simply put the alarm with the vice president over two days for a rare behind the scenes look on Air Force 2 and the Battleground state of Michigan close for the first time challenge
when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom
Nationwide as president of the United States I will probably sign it into law
and you have been clear that that is a priority but what you have not been clear on is what that bill would look like you've talked about restoring versus what restrictions you would support
let's put back in place Roe versus Wade
this was not an issue
when Roe versus Wade was intact for 50 years half a century
women together with their Physicians we're here at a medical office talking with physician
in women in consultation if they chose with their priest their Pastor the rabbi there a moment restrictions after viability I support
Roe versus
put back into
buy Cong
and to restore the fundamental right of women to make decisions about their own body it is that basic but you know there were there are restrictions with Roe versus Wade there were restrictions
we would not be debating this if Donald Trump had not hand selected
three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention they would undo
the protections of Roe v Wade and what we have seen
as as demonstrated last night and every day these last 2 years
is extraordinary
that has occurred in America were women have died because of trump abortion bands were women who have survived rape and girls ince
and and and and no except
for someone whose body has been violated to make a decision about what happens to their body next we have seen women who are experiencing
a Mis
around a pregnancy they prayed for
and being denied healthcare because doctors are afraid they're going to go to prison
and those women developing sepsis
we have seen extraordinary harm and pain and suffering
because of what Donald Trump did
in attending and effectuating and overturning of Roe v Wade yes
my first priority is put back in place those protections and to stop this pain and to stop this Injustice that is happening around
our country
and when you argue that Donald Trump is elected would put forward a National Abortion ban just read project 2020 the former president said that's not true he was because everything come on are we really taking his word for it
he said that women should be punished he's he has been all over the place on this
but I'm too busy watching what he's doing to see what he has said
Harris is on the trail in Pennsylvania today and she plans to make a major address this coming Tuesday
one week before election day you will be in Washington not in a Battleground state to give a major speech at the same place that Donald Trump did on January 6th why so I
and do think about that place more in the context of what will be behind me which is the white
I'm doing it there because
I think it is very important for the American people
to see and think about
who will be occupying that space on January 20
and the reality of it is that most Americans can visualize the Oval Office we've seen it on television
and
this is a real scen
sitting behind the Resolute desk in the oval
width 9 days left to go the vice president tells us there's no doubt about what her closing arguments will be
his first priority is going to be people like him
not people
the people who are watching this right now people who work hard seniors for example who are depending on that social security check as the only source of their income When Donald Trump is saying we should raise the age of of Social Security to 70 before you're eligible he says he's going to cut taxes on their benefits he has
been consistent
and and again Google project 202
about what he thinks about social security
and and why he thinks it is nothing that should be supported what he has his intentions to cut Medicare and Medicare benefits
his intention look again at project 2025
to repeal the 35.00 a month cap on insulin that we have put in place you know that Donald Trump is disavowed project 2025 he says that is not his campaign plan as you know I am a former prosecutor his DNA is all over
it's all
his running mate Rhodes forward
to the the book of the author of project 2025 I believe Donald Trump's name appears at least 300 times
in Project 2025 and it is a blueprint
a detailed bluep
that is about the danger and the detail of what Donald Trump and his allies
if he is in the white house again
CBS News has also asked former president Donald Trump to sit down with us to talk about this critical upcoming election
Mr Trump has thus far decl

filmmaker Ken Burns latest documentary
explore the life of Italian artist inventor scientist
Leonardo da
a renaissance man in every sense of the word
Burns is talking with our Renaissance Man David
ever since he got a movie camera for his 17th birthday Ken Burns has been making documentaries over the years he's created 36 documentary series for PBS all of them about American history but now well let's talk about the big news after Decades of making first class documentaries
you have a new
so Tom Brokaw told me when I turned 60 that I needed a big boy haircut and I sort of punted and so now that I'm 71 I you know I've had a bigger boy
haircut lately
but seriously there is some news he's just made his first project ever that's not about an American subject it's called Leonardo da Vinci it was just
getting to know one of the most
incredibly interesting human beings who is Ever Walked the earth and the fact that he turns out to be arguably the greatest painter
and certainly the greatest scientist of his age is
you know extra added it's so hard to make a film Burns co-directed the show with his daughter Sarah Burns and her husband David MCM
we all met up at New York's American Museum of Natural History
you're choosing as your subject somebody
there's no video there's no
photography
how do you make 4 hours on a person essentially doesn't exist the most definitely exists in the records that he's
he left Behind These 6,000 some odd notebook pages with all of these different studies geology
physics all of his Preparatory studies for his paintings grocery list to do list you're going to speak to the art historians are going to speak to the biographers you're going to find people who are influenced him across several
discipline Leonardo with paint portraits draw futuristic machines and make meticulous observations in dozens of notebooks
what emerges is a portrait of a genius who's not just a painter not just a scientist not just an inventor Leonardo Drew muscles bones and organs he wants to know everything about everything so he's dissecting a cadaver because he wants to understand how the heart works and how the body works all towards creating a painting that is more like more believable more alive it's one just
gigantic volume of
material asking
fundamental basic questions where do they come from where am I going how does the universe work I mean these are things that occupied him
every single moment of every single day
what also emerges is a man who rarely finished anything
he attempted how many paintings and finish how many there's fewer than 20 paintings that exist today and probably less than half of those are actually finished we think he was also coming across in this film is a world-class Pro
well I don't think there's any procrastination involved I think things are left un
run delivered to patrons because the questions
that he was asking of this
for him
had been satis
being interested in so many different things as he was that there's always the next thing a new question something else that comes along that takes away his attention
do things Da Vinci did finish though are among the most famous paintings ever made
well the last supper was a very commonly painted subject for Leonardo's
Leonardo discovers a completely different thing happening than most other painters had this is Christ telling his disciples that one of them is going to betray him
and he puts them in groups and so one is putting his hand over his eyes and other is reaching for a knife and so it becomes a pain that feels like seconds unfolding it makes you feel like you would have been a filmmaker today
how do you live
I think he invents film there's a kind of inherent dynamism and movement to it
he also made this
in order for him to be a great painter
he has to understand the circulatory system he has to understand about hair he has to understand about geography and rock formations and missed and how atmosphere works
and so my wish is that nobody ever makes a joke about her smile ever again
because
she is embodying the entire human project in that thing
if you've ever edited photos or videos on an iPhone or a Mac you may already know one of Burns's favorite editing techniques arms heads blankets guns and knapsacks for tossed into the clear air
zooming or panning across a still image
it's a process of trying to shake a live something that is two-dimensional and make it dimensional and
but the new documentary narrated by Keith David introduces techniques that will be very new to Burns aficionados split screens that juxtapose old and modern footage
across all of these disciplines showing multiple things on screen at the same time was a way of in some ways visually illustrating Leonardo's thought process what is the balance of Labor here how do you guys work together Dave and I are the writers of this and then once we have our
We Begin our editing process and that's when we get in there all together and work on making it better together occasionally we disagree about what that should be and it doesn't he automatically win cuz he's Ken Burns no no no that doesn't that doesn't work and that doesn't wash with collaboration
but now it's done it's delivered to PBS and you know that it's perfect you wouldn't change it many of Leonardo's designs were ornithopters machines that relied on the human-powered flapping of wings to achieve
Leonardo da Vinci airs on PBS in mid-november it's the story of a fascinating man
best gained through observation and experience
could feel I think quite rightfully that he had lived a fuller life than practically anybody I've ever
play come across
any study in

what others
show force is nothing but an expensive Band-Aid masking the human element of migration
that faces almost every border
they've traveled for hundreds if not thousands of miles they've been attacked they've been beaten they've been raped some of them have been killed
and when a little river like that is in the way they're not going to stop
the troops took over a Riverfront Park as a base of operations effectively closing it to the

the guys told me at first some of the members doubted a person with Down Syndrome could fit in with the group but they were willing to do Charlie the favor only to learn later the Charlie was the one doing them the
The Joint light that we were missing in our chapter that we didn't know we were missing from the beginning this is unreal he kind of broke all the all the preconceived notions that I thought of that a fraternity man should be like others have come to the same conclusion this year a total of six fraternities and five sororities all welcome students from Clemson life and according to Charlie it will be a game-changer
because he says something magical
