I want to play this
but we decided we shouldn't play it because it could get copyright strike and we don't want to get the episode when we don't want anybody to have any sort of way to get it down sure but it was the episode of you when you're on The View and I think it was 2015 or 2006 like when you were running for president
you sat you got introduced as our friend Donald Trump Whoopi Goldberg is a big hug and a kiss Joy Behar gives you a big hug
Barbara Walters gives you a big hug they all loved you
they were all talking about how
you might be
you might be conservative in your financial positions but you're very liberal socially they were they were talking about you in such a favorable
the audience was cheering
and then you actually started winning in the polls and then the machine started working towards you
there's probably no one
in history that I've ever seen
that's been attacked the way you've been
and the way they've done it so coordinated
and systematically when you see those same people in the past very favorable to you like Oprah when you want Oprah Show choose encouraging you last week I did one of her last shows I think maybe Thursday or Friday that was a big deal being on Oprah's show the last
and I was like one of the last shows in that last that final
and I said boy we've come a long way since since that what was it
well the concept it was really like two different lives you know I had
a very wonderful life but I wanted to do this The Apprentice was still going very strong we had 12 seasons
and we had actually
Seasons 12 years over we had a couple of The Apprentice when you were running for president
no they had Arnold Schwarzenegger do it I was involved in that
I want I had enough of it and we did great it was doing great but
they wanted me to stay they all came to see me they said
we're going to give you a contract they wanted to extend my contract Mark Burnett is a great guy
then they wanted to extend the contract Mark said you're crazy don't run don't run
nobody gives up Primetime they said you know it's one of those little things which
probably
navigate to 79% for for running well for running against 20 some other people get turned out to be 18 180 people you know mostly politicians
they said who would do this I mean it's a long shot actually the heads of NBC came over
Poltergeist all the top people came over to see me try and talk me out of it cuz they wanted to have me extend The Apprentice was doing well so it was 14 years we had one two seasons where we had a double which rarely happens it was just a hot
and I said you know I want to do this what happened is previously
3 years 4 years before that
they did a Paul they had Mitt Romney and somehow they put me in a
and I blew everybody away I blew him away which isn't that hard frankly but I blew everybody away and I said that's interesting cuz I never really
give it that much real thought I thought about it but never real thought but I saw these polls were very
and so I was thinking about doing it then but I had a contract with the Apprentice plus I was building two big buildings at the time and I wanted to make sure they got finished up properly and it's one of those things
the kids were just sort of getting involved they're very capable kids but they were getting involved early on
so I did that I got them done I had some very good success
and I came on and then I thought about it for the next one after the Romney disaster
and I ran on a one against Hill
there's quite an experience but it was a different life because you're right the view I was in The View many many times
and they love me I mean even if people have criticisms about you people that didn't like you there was always feuds and stuff like that but the reality was
the thing turned on you when they found out that you were going to be president it was very coordinated and some people are catching on to that now there's a lot of people that were long-time Democrats like Elon and Bill Ackman and all these different very intelligent people yes very supportive what does what I wanted to ask you
what was it
when you actually got in cuz nobody really can prepare you for that when you're running for president you don't really know what it's going to be like when you actually get into office
what was the what did you think is going to be in office or when I decided to run see when I was saying so when I was in and one and was in the White House essentially
well first of all it was very surreal
that should have been surreal when I was laying on the ground I knew exactly what was going on I knew exactly where I was
they were saying you
all over the place because there was so much blood from the ear
you would know that better than it would they get the earnings anyway so and and I was thinking the other day
when when that happened I really knew where I was I knew exactly what happened I said I wasn't hit any
with
with the presidency
it was a very surreal experience okay and what's day one
the old post office it was we called it Trump National
and we sold it to the Waldorf AST
and it was a wonderful thing but I'm driving down I'm passing the
