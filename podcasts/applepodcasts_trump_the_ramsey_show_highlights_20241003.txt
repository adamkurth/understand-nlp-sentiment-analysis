I'm going to say
as I was saying so when that happened and you get in the car
I saw it the other day that Melanie was watching on television yeah she saw
saw the
I saw your Dodge so you go down so you get up and
how fast were you able to get on the phone talk to her
well I know she she was calling and you know I was a little tough to take a phone call with blood pouring
there's a lot of blood
but no I spoke to her by the time I got to the hospital I spoke into her and she
she was sort of watching it
she had it held off for a couple of minutes and then somebody called her and said
he's okay he's okay she said what do you mean he's okay what does that mean
she had no idea and then she went back and pressed it and caught up
no he's tough for her tough for my son
he came out somebody had said
your father just got
and he came in and he was very
very
that was a tough day and
I don't recommend it for anybody I know I got very lucky or maybe maybe more than luck if you don't turn your head like you're talking about the immigration chart at the precise moment if I turn my head at the exact 90Â° angle if I was a little off one way or the other it's I'm not
doing this very nice interview with you I wouldn't be around to do this interview
