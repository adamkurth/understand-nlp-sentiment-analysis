hi everyone I'm Katie Couric and this is next question it's hard to believe but the 2024 election is less than a year away
what's even harder to believe
does Yogi Bear would say it's deja vu all over again
that's right
Biden versus Trump
we've been hearing a lot about the Republican side of the campaign with the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary and now super Tuesday is just over a month away
but we haven't been hearing as much
from the current Administration that's why I was thrilled to jump on a train Brave the elements and head to the Eisenhower executive office building to sit down with vice president Kamala Harris by the way these interviews can be very stressful
she's an incredibly busy person so they only gave me 30 minutes
and I had a lot to cover
abortion immigration Israel Gaz
the administration's historically low approval ratings despite their many accomplishments
Trump
and some crucial voting
but don't necessarily think the second time's the charm
thank you so much for being here
agreeing to have this conversation I'm very excited to talk to you about everything you're doing
we needed to clear up
why did I think you are much taller I recently learned you're only 52 is that is absolutely incorrect okay I am 54 and 1/45 * 3.5 thank you very much OK Google
I was 52 when I was 12
53 and 3/4
we started with a topic that's proving to be a powerful driver for Democrats
I know that vice president Harris you're embarking on a reproductive freedoms for yes to highlight the harm caused by
abortion bands and restrictive laws following the overturning of ropy
this is an issue that has resonated so much Democratic voters and I'm curious what is your goal
as you travel around the country
Michael My ultimate goal is that we will build
the
build and get a Congress that will pass
to restore the protections of
Angela and President Joe Biden will
then let's take a step back so I'm starting the renaming the fight for our reproductive Freedom tour and it'll begin on January 22nd which is the 51
anniversary of the Roe v Wade decision
you know I mean you and I'm going to speak for you I think I can accurate
most of our adult or are conscious lies right when we were able to be aware of what is happening in the world
Roe v Wade was the law of the
ropes when I was in 10th
so it was the law of the land
almost the entirety of our adult
and I'll speak for myself now
you know I always pro-choice pro-choice
Whenever there was a moment where we had to speak about the protecting role will let us protect
but honestly I pretty much I think most of us pretty much we were pretty certain I would always be here
and look
the highest court in our land
took a constitutional right that had been recognized
from the people of America from the women of
the day that that decision
came down
the world in so many ways in terms of a lived experience for the women of America changed in a drastic way
after the Dobbs decision which undid row came down
states around our country proposed and passed law
that would punish women
criminalize Healthcare
ban abort
in some cases even in the situation of Raper in
as you know I spent a lot of my career as a prosecutor and one of the reasons I became a prosecutor
sorry to share the story more
my best friend in high school when we were in high school I Learned was being molested by her
and when I learned that I said well you have to come and stay with us I called my mother my mother said of course she has to come stay with us and she
and so I decided I wanted to do the work that was about protecting
women and children from violence and the majority of my career as a prosecutor was focused on crimes against
so bring that back to the point of no exception even for rape
so these extremists so-called leaders are basically saying to a surv
of a crime of violence to their body a v
of
saying to these survivors
and you don't have the authority or right to make a decision
about what happens to your body
that's
Hudson
what I have seen traveling our country listening to women who have been directly affected
because of these
is the stories of women having miscarriages in toilets
there's a woman in Texas who have spent some time with
she and her her husband
she wanted to become pregnant she wanted to have children
and but her pregnancy she then had she was having a Mis
she went to the emergency
she was denied
because
the hospital workers were so afraid that they might get sued or
it is committing something against the law that they would not give her care it was only when she went back because she had developed sepsis
but they gave her
women around our country
experiencing a profound
because of these laws as a result of that Supreme Court decision
and many of the stories are Untold
many of these cases are women who are silently suffering and the other layer of this Katie that really
should be addressed and and and and understood
how these extremists
framing the the discussion in a way that really is about judging women
as though they've done something wrong
something they should be embarrassed about
and as we know when you
when people are already going through a moment in their
they need support not
and where they then feel because of this environment
they've done something wrong
they're going to silently suff
and they're going to feel alone which is very disempower
and so when I travel our country
listening to the stories hearing these women and thinking about this issue and how it is taking place in terms of the effect in real time
I feel
to travel as I've been
to organize folks and talk with folks about why we all should stand
for these basic freedoms the right of an individual to make decisions about their own body
pragmatically speaking man of Vice President
composition of the Supreme Court is unlikely to change anytime soon
what can you realistically do you were talking about electing people to Congress and passing
a law of federal
protecting a woman's right to
in the interim are there any other things
that can be done
to prevent these women from suffering the way they have been and particularly in very restrictive States like Texas and Idaho and Tennessee
well I'll start with what our Administration is working
which includes
fighting for an informing States about the responsibility to administer emergency care
the
to admin
emergency
and so that is part of what we are doing but there is a lot that the acronym is M tala but it basically says people cannot be denied
emergency
the work that we are doing to protect access to contrace
which is a real
there's work I've been doing for example to convene University president
of course
as the vast majority of their student population people who are in the height of their reproductive years
to ensure that they are doing what they can to protect medical records to protect privacy
to make allowances if
for example a student
has an unwanted pregnancy
receive Medical Care in their state needs to leave which means this time from class
even though they would have preferred to stay where they
so this is some of the work
the other work is around just talking with people about
the realities of it all for example
pointing out that I think we all agree
that one does not have to abandon their
are deeply held beliefs
to agree that the government
should not be telling her what to do with her
if she chooses she will consult with her priest or Rabbi her pastor or I'm
but it should not be the government telling her what to do so there are many layers to the work that I think needs to be done
including reminding
the individuals who are going through this right now the women who are going through it right now
that they're not alone and that we hear them and we see them
we do not judge them
and we want them to have the support that they so rightly need I also think there's a lot of disinformation about late-term abortions absolutely and I think a lot of misconceptions about that as well
women are having abortions
these horror stories about that how can you
educate the
had restrictions on the third trimester
not only that but let's just remember that
about whether women were doing these
things that people are now describing as possible or partial birth abortion and I just think that it is meant to
distract from the realities which is this and it's really basic and fundamental
I'm
this is about taking freedoms away
the freedom to make decision about your own
this is a question also of trust
I trust women
President Joe Biden trust women
to be able to know what is in their own best interest
and then make good decisions
and by the way and women trust us to know we're going to protect and fight for their
freed
but fundamentally that is the issue and
I think there are many people who want to distract from that fundamental foundational issue
and I take it to a foundational issue in terms of this is one of the the main principles upon which are our country was founded
do you think that this will motivate vot
referendum
and so how can you I mean I'm assuming that you're trying to encourage people who feel strongly about this issue
to go to the polls come no
because they can make a
literally
this issue
the ultimately determine about whether women have this Freedom or not
because of election
because of what will result from elections which is elected lead
passing a law to reinstate the
that have been Unleashed after the Dobbs decision so we want to go back
to the law of the land being
I think
elections matter Katie on this issue in particular election
after the break immigration the second most important topic for voters after the economy

I want to talk to you a little bit about
agrees that the immigration system is broken and we need comprehensive immigration reform early on I know you were tasked with understanding
the root causes of the immigration crisis but you are not in charge of the border which I think is important to point
having said that 14 house Democrats joined Republicans and denouncing the Biden administration's so-called open border policies calling it quote a national security and Public Safety crisis
as you know I'm sure you've talked to them so many Big City Mayors Democrats
are saying this is an untenable situation in cities across the country 68%
of Americans disapprove the way the Biden Administration is handled the border so
there's no
our immigration system
and it needs to be
and as with
problem
in
so I'm going to take you back to about 3 years ago and it was I think the day after our inauguration when we came
Joe Biden is President Mia's Vice
the first
that
was
to fix the immigration system and that's when you control both houses and Congress did not take it
and I will tell you that
but but sadly it has become so deeply
hard
and the subject of then political gamesmanship when in fact the solutions are at hand and we offered a
early on and invited
bipartisan work let's work on it
to
and in fact we have right now a proposal for 14 billion
so that we can put more resources to address this very situation and we hope and and and and and and
really trying to compel
in particular some of the republicans in Congress
to participate in the solution but sadly you know we want to fix it they want to run on it
they want a political issue to run on
well I don't I think that listen again I start I go back to where I started the situation is such that
the system is broken and it needs to be fixed and we have offered a solution and real leaders ought to lead on this meaning not play politics with it but work with us
Ukraine and Israel and Military ate those two allies desperately need
in order to release that Aid money so it's a work in progress so by the time your listeners listen to this conversation I don't know what what situation or status it'll be in but let me just say this
we ought to be able to do everything we are the United States
and that means fix problems
such as what we need to do to address the immigration system
and we must stand by our
and that includes giving Aid to Ukraine
which has been the subject of a violation of one of the oldest and most important rules in Norms which is the import
protecting sovereignty and territorial in
in the face of Russia's unprovoked aggression and attempt to use Force to change bord
the first
70 years in
in the United States must stand by our all
ew
on
to to stand strong about what is American leadership to uphold International rules in
and and and and and by the way I have not met with over 150 world leader SK
presidents prime ministers chancellors
many of them now multiple
they look to us
to be a leader on so many of these pictures I've been in the Oval Office with the president
was President Biden when he will get calls from world leaders asking for perspective and
so when we talked about the United States Congress on an issue like Ukraine or
we should be able to do all of these things and not put condition
on one in exchange for the other
it's been more than 3 months after the horrific attack
of October
people are seeing graphic images of
devastation
and thousands of Civilian casualties and gosh I'm sure you're seeing them too yes I
Spire for months now and I'm wondering if you could articulate for us why you believe
that is not a good idea if you do believe that
so let's start with
October
on October
we saw a terrorist organization
an act of sheer brutal
and
they attacked and slaughtered over 1,200 people innocent
many of them young people attending
women
not at all it is always around it's obviously but the barbarism is almost unspeakable
and
I will start this conversation by saying
and Israel has a right to defend it
and how it does
we've been very clear
far too many palest
innocent Palestinian civilians have
and that Israel must do more to protect
innocent
we've been very clear humanitarian Aid must flow from day one I will tell you one of my areas of priority included
let's think about the day after because we must stay focused on
eventual to State solution well I'm having said that I want to tell you something which I'm sure you're well aware
who recently said he rejected us calls to scale back Israel's military action in the Gaza Strip or to support a Palestinian state after the war he even said that Israel
must have security control over the entire
territory west of the Jordan River which includes Gaza so given those positions
how can you possibly come together how can the US and Israel come together to solve this
I'll start with the principles that we are applying to this
which we've been very clear with the Israeli government about
as it relates to the day after there should be no reoccupation of goes
there should be no changing of the territorial boundaries of go
the palestin
are entitled to in equal measure with Israelis
security
and prosperity doesn't sound like TV Netanyahu agrees with that
where the United States of America I'm telling you
we take our role in this discussion very seriously there may be disagreements that doesn't mean we're going to change our mind
about the principles that are important
to be applied to
this process in terms of what a day after
should look
and those principles remain consistent
We Believe very strongly I believe very strongly
Palestinians are entitled
to dignity and self-determination
we believe there must be a two-state solution for the
of the stability in the region We Believe very strongly as a first principle Israel must be secure
the
and it must not be in a position to commit terrorist
the people of Israel in particular so should
the prime minister of Israel is stating this should that Aid not come if
not that kind of flexibility that you're seeking
we are right now in a position of
negotiating with Congress to follow through on a commitment we made for
and we are taking it one day at a time in terms of what is happening in the region
and how we are addressing the issue but that's where we are right now
Administration
an infrastructure Bill finally
the chip
legislative accomplishments
low unemployment
millions of jobs created inflation down the stock market
and yes and yes
you and presidents binds approval ratings are at historic lows
the president at 38 you at 37
why do you think that is
well first of all if I listen to polls I would have never run for my first office or probably my second or third for that matter so I only put so much stock in polls but it must be discouraging we have to
we have to earn the
that is without any question the
place to be in a democracy you got to earn the re-elect and so
we have
historic accomplishments in terms of the economy but we've done to move forward
it's science technology and investment in the American Workforce growing the American Workforce Rising wages bringing down prices
historic work has happened no question it is incumbent on us
let people know who brung it to them
frankly because here's the thing Katie when
if you do if you do want to look at polling let's also look at the fact that
it tells us that if you ask
people how they feel about the fact that we finally kept the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month
hugely
if you ask people how do you feel about the fact that sin
too long too many had to determine whether they could fill their prescriptions or fill the refrigerator
and now we have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices finally
cost of prescriptions for seniors at $2,000 they're not going to pay more than $2,000 a year for their prescription
very very popular if you ask students with with
and he just announced today additional debt relief
we have now erased the debt of over 3 1/2 million people
very
if you look at what we are doing that
right now active project
in all 50 states that are about upgrading
roads and bridges repairing
streets in the airport
see some construction site
or a
that you can probably point to the biden-harris administration to know that that work is starting to happen because we fin
got the infrastructure work done
previous administration kept talking about infrastructure week we actually made it happen so you're right we have a lot of accomplishments and I think what the American people want most in their leaders
is that we actually get things done and we have done it
we haven't taken out of quick credit for it
and we got to do a better job of getting the word out
about what we have accomplished and who
when we come back comma Harris has a tall order making sure Latino black and young voters stay in the fold they have now met with over 15,000 students gen Z
by the way I think it is a terrific generation I know you love Genesis

black voters and Latino voters
in 2020 he won young people by more than 20 points but now he's tied with Donald Trump
and I'm curious
I think people believe you're a good Messenger to bring some of those voters back into the
to support Joe Biden and not just Kamala Harris how are you going to do that
well part of it is getting the
heck out of DC which I've been doing
I decided to get on the road ahead of the mid
and going to purple
red and blue States it almost equal
talking with folks and listening to folks and I started then last fall
college tours where I have now met with over 15,000 students gen Z
by the way I think it is a terrific generation I know you love Genesis it's a lived experience for them they've only known the climate crisis
they have most of them have endured active shooter drills between kindergarten and 12th grade they during their height of their reproductive years saw the court take away an essential right for
and so traveling the country
makes a difference to one lesson but to remind people that they are being seen and that what they do matters including that they vote and so I'm going to keep doing that are you worried that they're not going to turn out I mean that is so
key to your re-election well like I said many times because it is a mantra for me during election
there are two ways to
either without an opponent or
you got to
and you got to get out there and you got to do the work and I'm prepared to do it
you know I wasn't going to ask you a question about Joe Biden's age because after all Donald Trump is just 3 years younger
some people seem fixated
on Joe Biden
but I wanted to ask you
it's cuz they have nothing to run on
so they can they can have an issue but have in fact we have offered them the ability to solve it and they don't want to participate in that right and the solution right about immigration but having you know
the h
voters are concerned I mean
and I was curious to get your take on this 4 years ago I think it was a rally in Detroit
was at a rally with you
Cory Booker and Gretchen Whitmer and I looked up what he said he said
Joe Biden says look a lot doesn't he says
there's an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me
they are the future of the country
and I
that was a four-year Bridge
or an 8-year Bridge
I want to get to the heart of what I think you're ra
so let's talk about
I spend a lot of time with Joe
being in the Oval Office or The Situation Room
and I can tell you
this is someone
is tireless in terms of working on behalf of the American people
to your point of knowing Joe bid
he comes from a background and a place in his heart and soul where he cares so deeply about working people about families
we talked about his empathy because he actually is concerned about the suffering of other people and works to alleviate that suffering
he is
and it is because of all of that
that we have been able to
transformational
bipartisan work when we've been able to do it a large part of it is cuz Joe Biden and I've watched him Cincinnati Oval Office with the leaders on the two
and helps people figure out the compromise is actually a good thing Solutions are a good thing I have been in the Oval Office when heads of state from around the world in particular allies call up Joe Biden and ask for his advice and he gives
it is Joe B
who is without any question and leaders around the world would admit
the one who was able to bring together NATO to support Ukraine
this whole issue that they are raising about his age is again because they've got nothing to run on
I just think that we got to get Beyond this because I think ultimately
the American people deserve is that their
perform
by way of solutions and uplifting the condition of their lives I'm glad you use that word perform because I was listening to something Hillary Clinton said recently
of the nation's business are not
perform
I thought that was such an interesting right now and I thought that was such an insightful observation
because people doing the work let's face it or not that entertaining
but in the true sense of the word
perform in terms of are you actually doing anything
Joe Biden's getting a whole lot of stuff done
first chips and science act we're going to be investing in the future of technology
competing on a global level we have created over 850 new manufacturing jobs were bringing manufacturing back to America
what we have done in terms of fighting for things will you know this is again where it'd be nice to have a little bit more bipartisan support
extend the child tax credit in our first year by pushing it through
we've reduced our poverty by over 50%
that's the kind of Performing I think people want but how are you going to get that messaging out you know there seems I know but this alone as much as I would like to say the entire country listens to this or watches this
it feels like that somehow that is not getting through to a lot of people I know but but you and I know like people like David Axelrod are like let's get going people I appreciate that I appreciate where he's coming from in terms of
know what's
alright we all know what
on the other side of the split screen because let's be clear about it we talked about a lot of issues today you and I
most of which are not binary like it's not one thing or the other these are complex issues November of of 2024 binary
and on the other side
you've got
someone who has said that if he were back in office he would weaponize the department of
someone who
openly applauded insurrectionist as
someone who has said that they will
go after their political
and an applauds dictator
indicating that he would be
let's be really clear about what's at stake and then yes of course
there is then a desire that let's get out there
lose this
democr
and I agree with that passion
I I am motivated by the
I'm sure you're familiar with these 91 criminal indictments
Donald Trump is currently facing or somewhat familiar and I'm curious
why do you think so many of his supporters
are
to turn a blind
to those indictments and support him regardless
well let's see if they do in no
cases proceed I think that the majority of Americans
we're going to make the decision about the outcome of the election
want a liter
who is competent and not someone who invites and creates cha
I think they are going to vote for a leader
who respects and protects the rule of law not someone who breaks it
I think they want someone who
actually
understands that the real strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down but based on who you lift up your mind that people don't some people don't agree with that though that they're like we love this guy it doesn't matter
I don't
I don't I don't judge that I am just telling you
I know what is at
and we are going to spend every day
reminding the American people of what we have accomplished
what will be
