this holiday season Lululemon makes it easy to give a gift that goes beyond the moment they open it there's the sound of them unboxing super soft Lululemon loungewear and then there's the sound of them slipping into deep recovery mode after every workout
and now from The Institute of politics at the University of Chicago and CNN audio the axe files with your host David Axelrod
7 years ago I sat down with Kamala Harris then a newly elected US senator from California to talk about her life career as a prosecutor State Attorney General and her thoughts on the future
now she's the Democratic nominee for president of the United States so I thought I would share that conversation with you again
Senator Kamala Harris welcome thank you it's great to be with you good to be with you let's start with the name Pamela yes because it's a good way into this whole discussion about your interesting life
so it's my name
and it is actually a it's an Indian name which is a relatively common
people ask me how to pronounce it and so I did there are many ways if you were asking my grandmother she said comma I usually help people pronounce it by saying well just think of the hype in a coma and then add a lot at the end and that's it comma and it means actually the lotus flower
which is a very
it's a simple that is present in most Asian cultures and it represents
yes I learned it that you know the this flower sits on top of the water but it's its roots are grounded in the
and and that that's where you should be with your you know you should be able to do both and and have your feet firmly planted even if things look you know
lovely on top you still have to keep it grounded and something good today I think so you're your mom
your dad African-American jamaican-american so how did they meet
they met my parents met when they were graduate students at the University of California Berkeley in the 1960s and they were both active in the Civil Rights Movement
and my system my sister and I we joke we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full-time marching and shouting about Justice and that's what led me to want to be a lawyer because among the heroes of that great civil rights movement there were the lawyers Thurgood Marshall in Charles Hamilton Houston and Constance Baker Motley these individuals who understood the skill of the profession of louder to translate the passion from the streets to the courts of our country and to do the work that we know must constantly be done of reminding folks that promise we are articulated in 1776 but I want to get to I want to get to that in your career in the law but but I just want to hear a little bit more about
your folks and about the sort of cross-cultural upbringing and how that helps shape you
well you know it's it's funny David for and I'm going to bring it back to my childhood but you know it in my career when I was district attorney of San Francisco
attorney general California and even as now is the United States Senator
in each position I was the first
and and so in particular when I was Da and AG
reporters would come up to me and asked me this really original question put a microphone in front of my face what so what's it like to be the first woman fill in the blank the AJ and I'd look at them not knowing how to answer that question and I would tell him I'd really don't know how to answer that question because you
I've always been a woman but I'm sure a man could do the job just as well so
what what was it like to grow up
I had a great happy childhood it all seemed normal in Oakland I was born in Oakland
and it was I grew up in a community of people and immediate family in it and extended family
who were
really passionate about
about service and about Justice and it was very stimulating environment as I realize and and it really shaped and formed a lot of what I think about in terms of how
where my mother
she was supposed to she came to to to to to Berkeley California to get her PhD and she ended up being a very significant breast cancer researcher in endocrinologist in in the north and Bombay and Deli but the family is from the south and Madras which is now known as Chennai and but she grew up and and
she wanted to go into one of the best schools and my grandfather
you know this is the 1950s late 1950s my grandfather said you want to go to one of the best schools wherever you want to go you go
I'm going to support that so he let his daughter
from India to the United States and she was I think
to pursue her passion which is that she wanted to be
a scientist but she was so that speaks a lot about also the family that I was raised in
you know my grandfather and my grandparents were very
Progressive in the way that they thought about the world and who could do whatever they do my grandfather was one of the original Freedom Fighters and when India gained independence and the family stories included
often joking about my grandmother
who didn't even have a form she didn't really have a formal education she didn't go to college but she was one of the smartest people I've ever known and the family stories included a story about how she would go in the villages with a bullhorn and and and and and tell the village women about how they they have should have access to birth control and my grandfather would laugh about how your grandmother almost made me lose my job so I'm like mother then comes and she she goes to graduate school and she was supposed to go back to Indiana have a good arrangement
but you know she was active in the Civil Rights Movement naturally because of the family that she came from and met my father
and made the very courageous decision to have a love marriage and in that really as
describe it and think of it was you know an incredible Act of self-determination I grew up in an extended family where my second mother
Mrs Regina Shelton
she emigrated from Louisiana
to California as did her husband Mr Shelton from Arkansas in that wave of black folks from the south who went to California for the jobs that were being created in particular through the Naval Shipyard and all that and she was a second mother to me and my sister
and my parents divorced when we were young and she was
she ran a nursery school we lived on top of the nursery school in an apartment above the nursery school we used to go down there work at the nursery school and volunteer
Mrs Shelton was an extraordinary woman in terms of just how much he gave back to the community
she ran this Nursery School she would always take in Foster youth foster children I remember
there was a situation where there was a young mother
who clearly as I realize now had been experiencing domestic violence
and she took in the children for
couple days and and made sure that that mother could get her self together and take care of her situation so I grew up
in an incredible environment you mentioned your mom and your second mom what about your dad that you have so you know
part of the reality of those days when couples got divorced is the mother got custody and without much question and debate we would see my father on the weekend
economics professor at Stanford and we would spend Summers with him from time to time and and he definitely was a part of our life but my mother was the primary let me ask you about him because this was a 60s so
that's a noteworthy as well you have an African-American man who's pursuing his Doctorate in economics tell me about his family how did he get to that so my father was a national scholar in
he was and he is a very smart very smart and academically just this was his his passion and he excelled and and became a national scholar and So based on Merit he then went on and pursued his passion which was economics and and was at Stanford eventually but met my mother at Berkeley
so really two parents who were drawn here by the opportunity to study at some of the best schools in the world I just want to ask you in the context of today's
debate
we're debating who we should let into our country and so on
that day do your parents do their experiences help shape
you're thinking about this
yes yes of course and you know I mean listen
it is my personal experiences it is also the it is everything I learned in law school
it is everything I learned about the history of this country
a student in college
it is all of my experiences of prosecutor
that lead me to my perspective on what is wrong about what's happening currently in terms of the treatment of immigrants and and what we need to do to correct ourselves and so I say all that to say it is all of those influences that taught me that we are a nation of immigrants
all of those influences that have shown me that when we allow any community of people to live in the shadows they will be the victims of predatory practices and crimes
all of those experiences which have taught me that we have a Constitution of the United States which bestows certain rights there in anal
we that we are a country of laws all those experiences which have taught me that we need to provide people with access to an attorney if their Liberty is at stake which is why the first bill that I've dropped in the United States Senate is a bill that if passed will give
immigrants and refugees the right to have access to an attorney and not be denied just a few weeks ago an injustice
your folks
contributions that were really
important as do people at all walk in all walks of life
but I'm stuck I mean I'm the son of an immigrant I'm struck by
just how much this country relies on
people coming here
joining in and contributing
and your education system obviously is one magnet for it it seems that something to be celebrated
it's certainly something to be celebrated it's also you know I grew up
I grew up in an incredible Community it was a very nurturing environment
I grew up in the black community where
you know it and again in the 70s when we were still fighting so much about what
unjust the injustices and I put the experience that immigrants are having currently in that category as well
when when when when when any group of people are being denied
there's a suggestion they should be denied access to fundamental
services like public education public health or Public Safety that's an injustice so I look at it through many lands which include the circumstances of my birth in every way the circumstances of my birth being a child of the Civil Rights Movement the circumstances of my birth being the child of of people who are not born in this country and and an elected to come here wanted to come here and I look at it again through the lens of my professional as a prosecutor
do you
you know I obviously
my old boss of President Obama wrote famously about
his search for identity and
did you go through a process like that did you
I mean you know
I usually when people eat a journalist for example asked me to talk about that
I'm happy to have that conversation but if you want to have a topic if you want to have a conversation about race in this country then if you have about four or five hours to put aside or four or five days and then let's go for it and then let's go for it right because you know so for example so for example
my mother
understood quite well
is she understood what it meant to raise her two daughters
in the world in which we were born
she knew like we all know the history of this country in terms of the 1/8 rule write 1/8 of black blood you are black and you will be treated that way both in terms of the benefits and in terms of the the the the the the drawbacks leg
my mother
that's a complicated thing for people to understand
when because unfortunately some people infer that by saying that and and knowing that that that's not somehow a rejection of who I am as the daughter of an Indian woman and there is no reason I think it's a recognition of the society in which we live and it absolutely I mean and it raises so many points that we're now battling today in terms of even you know just what's going on with different communities in terms of stereotypes in terms of profiling in terms of desperate treatment based on how one appears what and who wants to be look at this incident that just happened where Indians were but this this fellow decided that they don't know basically he must have put a whole bunch of brown people in one category
and decided they must be Iranians and and committed
horrible act so perception of who someone is
can I have a direct impact on the experience they have in life about that story
I mean it was it was
horrifying Beyond description
but there was one element of it that I think has been under-reported which is that when the shooter was first kicked out of the bar
one of the patrons came up to these two Indian men who were at who were there
and and apologized and wanted to buy them drinks and then they engaged in the discussion about
about these kinds of attitudes and how
it is and and then of course when
they
this courageous young guy gave Chase
I always feel like
ever since I read that I feel like I should note that because because those folks represent
America you know those are good Americans who reacted in the way you would
and we should we should not forget that and I and I agree with you completely in this era this I've been referring to it as this post 11 8 world
I've
reminding people in myself
of that simple fact that you just presented through that story which is we are a great country
imperfect though we may be we are a great country we were founded
on on certain ideals Noble ideals right including those words we wrote in 1776 we are all and should be treated as equals and it is my life experience that the vast majority of people believe in that
and we'll fight for that and we'll fight against unfairness and Injustice and and I think that you're absolutely right and who knows how those folks voted by the way
in the presidential race
because what they did the odds are though that they may have
look for Mr Trump that's my point yes that's exactly 5 point that's exactly my point
yeah so let me just ask you one last question and I want to talk about your your career in the law
do you get sick of these questions I mean you know I mean I know these anthropological discussions and all of that that that that seemed to be a Fascination when people write about you and probably when people talk to you in in in in in in discussions like this
I mean is there a little thought box above your head saying oh not this again
you know I was raised to
that's just I was raised that you do you don't talk about yourself
you just do you don't talk about it after you've done it you just do the next thing and I realized when I first ran for office that
people on demand that you talk about yourself and it it just naturally is something that is you know I would prefer to talk about what needs to get done versus talk about myself so I ask because you know there was this profile in the times in one of the things they said was that you
you know reticent about talking about yourself so yeah I just I mean let me ask me to talk about anything about what needs to get done what you know
I'm happy to do that I just I don't I think it's something that the things that we need to talk about are so much bigger than than me
that you know but I'm happy to talk about myself but you know I get it but you know the fact is
this on this podcast I try to talk to people about their lives cuz I think your life informs who you are but I will say this we are we are a wash and politicians would like to talk about themselves these days so I appreciate your your your your your reticence in that way we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with more of the axe files
churches original recipe is back you can never go wrong with the original 1099
I'm Dr Sanjay Gupta host of the Chasing Life podcast there are nearly 7 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease it's the most common neurodegenerative condition in the world but in the process of filming a recent documentary called the last Alzheimer's patient I saw some incredible signs of
Alzheimer's prevented and even sometimes reversed listen to Chasing Life
streaming now wherever you get your podcast
and now back to the show
you chose to become a lawyer but what's interesting to me is you became a prosecutor very like thing to do
tell me why you made that decision
so you're right to ask the question that way
but I'll add something to it which is this you know I was born in Oakland and I grew up in Berkeley in the Flatlands on the other side of the tracks you know I am of a family of people and community of people
who are Marching and shouting for just
and and a community who also historically
had relationships with law enforcement that were not good it was law enforcement that enforce the Jim Crow laws it was law enforcement that when my mother was marching she shared stories about how
that they were marching from Berkeley into Oakland and the police department lined up to say you could not go beyond
so when I
when I got out of Law School
I made a decision to become a prosecutor and you're absolutely correct David my family and extended family sat around and they said oh well now that's a curious decision and with some of them I had to defend the decision like one with a thesis right I mean most of the people I know who went to law school you know became
did I went to public Advocates or ACLU or are they became they became public defenders and my point then
which I maintain today
is law enforcement has such a profound and direct impact on the most vulnerable Among Us and has as its responsibility as its job to be a voice for the voiceless in the vul
and I wanted to do that
the other point was and is this
when you want to improve a system
certainly there is a
to be played about you know marching and about banging down the door and sometimes on bended knee there is also a
which is to be at the table where the decisions are made and influence the system
and so that's what I decided to do the other point that I'll raise with you is this
when as a prosecutor I stood before
a jury and said listen
the penal code was not designed just to protect
the proverbial Snow White
when my Victim was a prostitute who was drug addict
and also victim of
I as the district attorney of San Francisco the
top law enforcement officer of major city in this country was able to create and design and initiative focused on giving jobs and education and parenting support
to to former offenders
as the Attorney General of the State of California the top cop of the biggest
having the power and the position I was able to create a whole Statewide initiative focused on Early Education and getting in particular
children access to what they need to be able to go to school every day and it was focused on each of Elementary School truancy so I I recommend to every law student that I meant
you want to go you want to be great you want to you want to go into you want to go into fighting for civil rights Social Justice Criminal Justice Reform become a prosecutor because you then have the power to make the decisions which include by the way
also acknowledging a certain myth right which is a myth for example that the African-American Community does not want law enforcement
we don't want excessive force we don't want racial profiling but we want law enforcement
all people want to know if a child is molested if a woman is raped if someone is killed all people want to know there will be serious and severe and Swift accountability and consequences so I reject the false choices
it does raise difficulties though in terms of
well let me just throw this out here I come from Chicago I don't know you the president keeps mentioning it in his speeches
there are neighborhoods in our city where you have
unremitting violence and it's been Dreadful
we've also had cases of excessive force that were Dreadful and very well publicized and
the result is there's a reticence on the part of the police and there's a reticence on the part of the community and there's this massive Gulf of trust and in that ghoul
you've got
gangs flourishing and guns blazing how do you how do you balance these things in such a way that you have
effective law enforcement in those communities and respect for civil rights and cooperation between the community and police which is necessary as you know to solve these crimes
Patricia say I was I
proud as attorney general California to do
what we believe is a national model around we developed a training protocol for police officers on implicit bias and procedural Justice the first of its
because of the the relationships and the influence that I had as attorney general the state working with law enforcement and working with Community folks and academics we were able to Institute it as is now a part of the training that is offered for all police officers in the
very important because you know on this issue of implicit bias part of what we have to recognize is that people
quick decisions based on familiar reference points
it's an interesting thing how the brain works you when you have to make a decision about anything you will go to that thing that is familiar and so what are you making a decision about that could be a decision about what is art
what is pleasurable music
what is
what is
so we want to train people who are going to make a decision that can have a consequence on someone else's life
we want to train them to reflect on
the fact that they may not be considering everything that is happening at that moment that's the training that I'm talking about as attorney general we were able to do that with my office and that is one thing that I think should be a national model
to address part of the point that you're raising which is the relationship of trust between the community and law enforcement so the training piece around implicit bias is important the other piece that is important is to acknowledge
that in any relationship of trust
professional or personal relationship it is absolutely critical that we speak truth
and because there must be honesty in a relationship if there's going to be trust that means recognizing the truth around the history
of the relationship that many communities have had with law enforcement not only the black community LGBT community can talk about all of the enforcement of laws around sodomy that caused people to be criminalized there is what needs to happen around acknowledging what is going on in various communities all of that is important in the training and the trust okay I'm going to put that aside the other point about what I think we needs to happen to deal with this point is we have to reform the criminal justice system
so that we are not being purely reactive
we need to have a honest conversation about what is the role of of law enforcement and if the in a law enforcement system is it only to enforce the law or is it also especially if you're talking about DA's and and prosecutors is it also to do everything we can to keep a community safe
and if we agree that the goal is ultimately to keep the community safe then we have to appreciate that we will be most effective if we adopt the public health model
which teaches us you want to deal with an epidemic be it health or crime smartest most effective and cheapest way to deal with it is prevention first
are you dealing with an emergency room or the prison system too late and too expensive and that means also creating an environment where law enforcement is a part of the prevention piece and not just the reaction piece California though has been
boys of model of prevention but a model of detention and incarceration yeah exactly you know a young man walked into my office
at the University of Chicago at The Institute of politics
the other day named Michael Tubbs who you know the 26 year old mayor of Stockton California he told me his story which was that his father
who is 17 years old went to prison under three strikes and he's still there
today and you know his mother heroically raised him firmly and with great guidance and must be very very proud of him today but it just underscored
the fact that you have pretty draconian
laws there to have they contributed to safety
so we
we ended three strikes a couple years ago because it just became very clear based on how it was being used and implemented it was not achieving its intended
and you're right California has not been a model of Reform we were the first to to pass three strikes and and the success in California allowed it to be replicated in other states in fact you'll appreciate the point that you know people say to me oh you're from the Left Coast Oh No Such Thing California voters passed three strikes California Proposition 13 187 around immigration but it was undone by the course prop
they tend to be and can be very conservative
what I think is important going forward is that we start to evaluate each of these states in our criminal justice system in a way that we apply
metrics to our analysis of Effectiveness I think that's that's going to be where if we do that that's where we make the
okay which is a plyometric store an
looking at for example like in California
within three years of release up to 70% of those who are incarcerated reoffend that's just a bad return on the investment I love my friends in the private sector they are cold-blooded and their analysis of their effectiveness unburned by ideology
they just asked simply what's the row
we need to do that in terms of the criminal justice system and we'll see that we're failing taxpayers the other piece that I would really strongly urge us all to do all of us who want to see reform in these systems is we have got to fight for the adoption of Technology by government and I'm going to tell you why
we have in maintaining government
incredible trolls of information called dat
about all of these folks were in the systems and we collect this data and we put it in a room and we close the door and it gathers dust but now technology exists for us to be able to analyze all that data
to see where we are in terms of the the the the the patterns and and and and really do an analysis of the return on the investment you know for example and I'll say this about technology you know when I came out of law school we had big data
right and you know what it looked like it was just really tall aluminum file cabinet with thousands of files that was big data now with technology Big Data means a whole other thing we can write code switch a button
an analyzed all
and I think that's going to be part of the the the the the the the step towards making this much more persuasive the point which is that you don't have to agree with me ideologically about what's not
it's literally that the taxpayers are not getting a fair return on the investment the other piece is we started a whole big data initiative when I was age of California around criminal justice around
deaths in cust
police officers killed in the line of duty in a restaurant because I had one of the largest sources of information about people who are incarcerated and arrested because it's the largest state in terms of population and let me tell you David what it showed without any depth of analysis and then I challenged all of the press and academics to also test their hypothesis what we saw without any depth of analysis is this California California is black population 6% of the population
20 almost 25% of in custody
that put aside
a conversation that was happening where people were saying Oh Black lives matters they're just shouting and and they're marching and and what are they talking about well perhaps they're talking about it with antidote and emotion
but they're talking about the same thing the data shows which are there there are disparities in the system based on race the president's been talking about crime lately he's been injecting that into his speeches as we sit here and chat today he's about to speak to a joint session
of Congress and my guess is it may come
again tonight and he is conveyed the sense that crime is out of control all over the country
using Chicago as a kind of poster child for that but that's that's not
it is not true and it it's deeply troubling because this is exactly what got us into the mess which is creating a climate of fear
and and attempting to sound tough
in order to be for people to assume that he is in fact tough in dealing with the problems if you think it's do you think that is there's race and
Sur
I think it's it's it's it's it's load
with all kinds of things that are really all about politics and not about
policy and not about fact
and that is that enough not to answer my question
but I truly believe that it is sort of tinged a little bit of when you said
of course there's that component of it that's part of the history of this topic in our country
Friday it's the Willie Horton that that's still that still exists
you know when people are when you make people feel afraid and then
I guess he's assuming that they look at him for some guidance about creating a solution so it's it's a problem it's a solution in search of a problem
it's irresponsible before you got here and I know you
part of the movement
encourage
Congress was working toward some sort of significant Criminal Justice Reform and
now we have Jeff sessions as attorney general are you
confident that that can get them you have organizations like the Koch brothers
Terry Crew and it's not working in favor of
Criminal Justice Reform it's been kind of an interesting left-right Coalition on this issue do you do you think it's a doable thing now so here's how I think about criminal justice policy I think we have been offered a false choices of the country
the first choice is to suggest that you're either soft on crime or your tough on crime instead of asking are we smart on
and by that I mean again looking at the public health model which is taught us prevention is a smart way to achieve safety
10 reaction
and my concern is I have just read that now Attorney General Sessions is talking about shutting down or or minimizing the work that the United States Department of Justice has done an investigating cases of of excessive force and racial profiling
it is it is doing a disservice to all of us and I'm deeply troubled
and what about the the bigger project of sentencing reform and so on did you see that moving forward
yes and I want to be and I've talked with some of
my colleagues here both Democrats and Republicans I am hoping that we're going to be able to make some Headway I think that on the issue for example for example of opioid abuse
you know we still have lingering effects of that War on Drugs which was a failure sentencing reform will be a part of of repairing the harm
and that of course cuts a wide swath right through the base of President Trump's Constitution absolutely right and that and see and that again is the point of of what is wrong with this
this approach that is about reaction and not looking at things like drug crime through the lens of a public health matters much as a criminal justice matter it's just doing a disservice to families and communities and we're just paying so much more to to put it in the criminal justice system and not treated also in the public but you think there's still a possibility to get something done I think there is if we
I think we can find Common Ground if we start a discussion around opioid abuse and what we need to do around treating it as a public health matter and by that I mean looking at what we can do to encourage Public Health responses to the substance abuse aspect of it instead of reacting by incarcerating a bunch of people who are substance abusers and and and and and have mental health related issues some of them and have issues that relate to their families and their children
I think we can be much smarter in terms of the way that we handle the issue so that it becomes less of an issue than it is right now and I think that Republicans like Democrats go back to their states and they meet with these families they meet with the parents of these young people who are addicted they meet with the children of the parents who are addicted
and they know it's a real issue for them places like Kansas places like West Virginia but a variety of states
that that are not burdened by whether the the substance abuser is the Democrat or Republican it's just a problem
yeah we had
JD Vance on on this podcast at the University talking about his book hillbilly elegy and his
mom got swept up in the drug epidemic as did many in his community and he's actually gone back there
work on it so it's it's a perv
is a problem we have to put the we have to understand that that it's been marginalized as affecting certain communities and not others and it is
drug abuse is something that does not discriminate
based on race and frankly not even based on class because I've met a plenty of families who also have a concern and upper middle class families about prescription drug abuse you know frankly we our country has an insatiable appetite for drugs
we need to deal with that at its
you're interested in talking to him though and we had a little colloquy between him and a guy named Alex kotlowitz who wrote a book called There Are No Children Here years ago about the projects of Chicago
so the dystopia there and what was interesting was how similar the experiences were and the common element was sort of lack of Economic Opportunity and and and and and and hope so this drug crisis obviously it's addictive
but it's also symptomatic of something larger
so for years I worked on the issue of
children who are growing home growing up in
Community or home where there is violence
and
and or children who are experiencing tra
to post traumatic stress disorder in children that goes undiagnosed and untray
you don't be clear that poverty induces tra
and again it does not distinguish based on race and so the need for addressing it early on in that child's life detecting it diagnosing it and treating it because
unless we do
like any normal human being anyone experiencing trauma does not like feeling pain
so they will find ways to not feel that pain
and that is
drugs and alcohol
and so part of what I think we have to do a better job of in terms of a public policy push on the issue of drug addiction and these various communities is also do much more around intervention with children who are growing up in these homes and making sure that we are giving them all that they need so that they can
live through that experience in a way that allows them to be helping yeah I would submit that we also have to go to the
issue which is if you have communities in which Economic Opportunity is scarce question mark we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with more of the axe files
and now back to the show
let me talk a little bit about the political moment in which we're in and how Democrats sort this out
there are there's a point of view some of it emanating right there from the bay area where you where you come from that
the order of the day is to resist
and resist everything in other words whatever this President says whatever he does whoever he appoints should be resisted
and in part of that was is is is is is is
provoked by a sense that that's the way
President Obama was treated
part of it is based on outraged about some of the approaches of a of a Donald Trump
react to that what's what's your strategy
for dealing with this president in your new job as a senator
well you know I I start
put the perspective that
to the extent that there is any possibility of alignment
I would welcome
but at the point that we differ in terms of basic principles and priorities
we're going to have
do you see any any possibility that you see things that are bubbling up that you are on which you might want to work with them with the administration infrastructure if there is an a genuine desire to do that in a way that is
supporting for example
California's needs we have I just
the the Oroville
like in many places in the state without adequate maintenance and an up
and this is relates to water it relates to Transportation throughout the country
if if there is a genuine Desire by this Administration to focus on
infrastructure and upgrading infrastructure in this country around water and transportation I would joy
what the administration on that if it is a true commitment to actually putting the resources into the states to build back up the infrastructure which by the way will also
on an issue like immigration how would you how would that be received I mean
I welcome that I I
kind of question
efficacy of saying no we're not going to repair that damn because it would have politically negative implications I think that that's
that's a bad world but how would that be received in if you were having a town hall in Berkeley
I think it would be well-received I believe most people to be reasonable people
and if
people understand that where we can do something that is about bringing jobs to the
and improving the quality of life people have because we have you know roads that are prepared
or we have dams that are that are reformed and replaced
then and and water infrastructure around a storage of water
then I think people will welcome that but
I've not seen
any movement toward that yet and so I will tell you the current relationship I have with this Administration which is in particular through the Committees I sit on and the appointments that this president has made to his cabin
and we have strong disagreements and I've been fighting against those for example what is going on around this Muslim
outrageous
outrageous and so the work there has been everything from critically the questioning a general Kelly who has since been confirmed by voted against him but confirmed as the head of Homeland Security to calling him up at weekend when the when the executive order was issued because I was getting numerous calls from attorneys who are at Dulles and at LAX and SFO trying to have access to these refugees and being denied
when I when I learned that that they were making decisions about these refugees who had been in a vetting process for 2 years and had cleared that vetting process and and they were still denying them legal entry at that point
we we have to find let me ask you about another one which is the Supreme Court appointment as you know just judge Garland
language without a hearing for the better part of the year and so there are those who say
democrats should filibuster judge gores
find and let's just stipulate cuz I don't want
waste your time that I'm sure you're going to give him do consideration and all of that stuff so we'll stipulate the disclaimers
to oppose his nomination a serious concern of mine I
fully vetted his his background yet but
based on what I have read and
I have serious concerns about his role in in terms of for example Hobby Lobby
I'm serious concerns about his interpretation of leather Corporation is a person
but I do believe that we should maintain the
5% threshold
so you wouldn't feel about you wouldn't you think you should so you think that there should you would
play filibuster
we'll see if the circumstances if you oppose his nomination you think that the 60s should be
I think that we should not
we should not allow I'm getting tangled up in my own words
we should not allow
the rules to change this with these were the rules under President Obama
Democrats agreed
rightly even though we were in the majority
and it shouldn't be maintained which is for the for a confirmation of an individual to sit on the highest court in this
there should be a
vote threshold and nothing lasts but the ability to change the rules it may be out of your hands with 52 Republicans
you
so
doesn't mean we don't fight
all right so you're basically urging
Democrats
McDonald's hours to produce 60 votes exactly yes
let's take this out of the
the political realm and just talk about the significance of the United States Supreme Court and the impact the directed impact it has on real human beings had
Earl
the previous a previous attorney general California
not let the unanimous Court to decide Brown B Board of Education I would not be here
talking to you as the United States sin
I had decisions but not been made around Voting Rights Act and and and and and what needs to happen around issues like choice
people's lives would have been very different
and so the the and and we know that members of the United States Supreme Court stay there for a very long time
and we have to we have to give deference to the responsibility the enormous responsibility of those positions and have a process that is fair and that has the highest standard in terms of the
by which someone will ultimately be able to sit on that
there's a movement that's been organized to challenge
Democrats
are seen as complicit or compromising with
with president and presumably the Supreme Court will be well you've got a bunch of colleagues who are from more conservative States what would you say to those who say
they should be punished if they stray
so here's what I have said
2018 is really important
I've got plenty of friends
who are really watching very closely what each person does in terms of the vote they take but to my friends I'm saying this
you may not agree with everything that some of the 2018
you may not agree with every one of their positions
we need the numbers
we need those numbers and so
just practically speaking
I hope that we don't walk away from
other Democrats we may not agree with on everything because ultimately we need to come as close as we can to that 60%
and the numbers matter
yeah and States differ in California is not Missouri who are going to be running in 2018 in states where
Trump won by almost double digits
so you know I mean this is a question perhaps for everyone to ask and reconcile with you know themselves and their God which is is it more important to
you know what's more important is it important to keep those
or to sacrifice them
for the sake of
no one there then someone who or no one from my party
then someone who is complicit in supporting policies or appointments
or a president who who I find
unaccept
I just don't think it's a zero-sum game and that's my point I don't think that we can I don't think that
when we're talking about this issue that
we can afford to only think about
an All or Nothing game when there are some Democrats who are up and we don't want those
does seats to shift to a republican in this in this environment so and you know I don't I don't necessarily I don't agree with
my colleagues Democratic colleagues on on this certain issues so I completely understand the need for advocacy not suggesting anything other than that we should everyone should be advocating they should be speaking they should be speaking out they should be attending the rallies they should be attending the the town halls I strongly encourage that that happens but at the end of the day
it's a question that we just it's a practical real question that we're going to all have to answer
which is what do we want
and for those Democrats were running in those States
do we want that they will be there at the end of the day or we willing to let them go and
all over this country are there any colleagues on the Democratic side who you wouldn't campaign for
let's talk about the hot new ticket thing because this is a party that is
was stunned obviously on 11/8 as you as you put it
and the question immediately became what now and who can lead us forward and I actually worked for a new senator who immediately started figuring in the National speculation and when Barack Obama came to the Senate it wasn't his intention to run for president in 2008 and we were very leery of it because we didn't want the folks back home to think
that he was just having a cup of coffee on his way to somewhere
else I presume you feel the same way
and what he and he ruled out
running for office in 2008
and then he ended up
having to resend that so
in order to avoid discomfort later I want to give you the chance to answer that question and give yourself the question is would you would you rule out running on on the National Ticket either on the top or is the vice presidential candidate in 2020 not thinking about that at all
I've seen so many people
focus on that thing out there and they trip over the thing right in front of them it's so not worth it because right now the thing in front of us is very real
it means like our bill in terms of access to council what we're doing in terms of fighting for the dreamers and the DACA kids what we're doing in terms of potentially having to fight as it relates to you know whether Jeff sessions is going to be the one doing an investigation around issues that he probably should recuse himself on the same thing with Scott PR
who I voted against who is now going to be the head of the EPA and as Attorney General of Oklahoma he sued the EPA this agency he now runs but has refused to say he recused himself from those those cases there is so much happening right now and and it's frankly it's a it's a very troubling time I'm not using the word scary because I don't want to
make an alarm is but there are a lot of very big issues that are on the table right now and we have to we have to be alert and present like right now ya know
there's an incredible amount of of potential undoing
of everything that Barack Obama and others including George Bush
put in place
you know you mentioned sessions and there's something that I neglected to ask when we were talking about the Police Issue there were some consent decrees or or or or agreements to negotiate consent degrees in Chicago in Baltimore now up to this justice department to follow up on
there's some discussion that that's not going to happen because Attorney General Sessions has said he wants to take a
what's a prop
Stan how how will you react if they decide not to move
I'm very troubled by that and and all else to say this
as a career prosecutor if I worked my entire Adult Career with cops
the vast majority of
take seriously they're old and they do a good job
and then there are the bad apples
and they may not talk about it publicly
but they want as much as you and
that we get rid of the bad apples
they know that it's not in their best interest it's not in the best interests of their safety
it's not in the best interest of just that the sacrifices they make every day knowing that they may not come home at night
so the idea that that that that that this top law enforcement officer for the country would say we're not going to go after the bad apples is ridiculous and it's counterproductive
it's absolutely counterproductive it's no secret that there are bad apples
and where they exist there should be as much consequence and accountability for them is anybody else
who commits a
are are fails to follow the rules
and this is not about again it's a false Choice that's being present
Jerry the pro police officer or your pro civil rights enforcement that's a ridiculous false choice
you can and should be both
what do you think the motivation for it is do you think it's rooted in politics or do you think it's rooted in philosophy
I don't know but I think it's it's rude and ignorance
you've never been in a I just want to leave this here this is your first
legis
body you've been a prosecutor you've run
an attorney general's office
how are you
how are you reacting to how are you adjusting to being one of 100 in a body that isn't run by your own
there's an adjustment period for someone who's used to having a staff being able to make decisions
being able to see the results of what you've done
and there's no question there's an adjustment I mean as as attorney general and nsda I work very closely with the legislature
helps on pass the number of laws little known fact I was when I was at Howard University as a sophomore I was a senate intern for Alan Cranston then Senior Center California who Barbara Boxer succeeded and now I'm here
but you're right there is
it is a
but having said that I also say that you're right that this is a different time than we've seen before and that there are some traditions of the Senate that just don't apply to this point in time at least for Democrats and that relates to for example speaking out and speaking loudly about a number of issues that we know are wrong and disagree with I think I've always seen that in my offices there are three elements of power
there is the element of power that comes with the statutory and Technical responsibility of the job there is the power that comes with the bully
at any moment I can have a bouquet of microphones in front of me right and then hopefully then we use that as an opportunity to elevate public discourse and public education and then the third piece which I think is sorely underused is the is the power to conven
to bring people together around a common issue and breakthrough silos and actually move an agenda
and I look at those as being co-equal frankly in terms of the impact that we can have on people and and human lives and so that's how we've been approaching this job it's been from all of those angles and
and so far I think we're having some impact I
home this weekend and convening refugees were coming from Syria and talking about what we can do in terms of giving them a bully pulpit in terms of their experience so that hopefully we can impact public perception about who these families are
it's been the work of of meeting with folks who are working on criminal justice policy to again highlight the good work that is happening and and hopefully have some impact then on my colleagues who are listening to this reactive kind of stuff
and hopefully get them to a place where we are more productive than that so you're you're adjusting yes well it's I must say that now that I know what the roots of the name Kamala the fact that you describe
the microphones in front of you as a bouquet makes more sense to me but Senator Kamala Harris thank you so much for being with us thank you thank you for listening to the axe files brought to you by The Institute of politics at the University of Chicago and CNN audio the executive producer of the show is Miriam Fender Annenberg the show is also produced by Carolina Barry Jeff Fox and Hannah Grace MacDonald and special thanks to our partners at CNN including time and Haley Thomas for more programming from the IOP visits dot Chicago
