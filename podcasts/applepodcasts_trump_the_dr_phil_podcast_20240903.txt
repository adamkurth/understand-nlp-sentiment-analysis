you've been really busy and I have to ask you it's been 7 or 8 weeks
since would be assassin Thomas Matthew crook
climbed on top of a roof on a shockingly close building right in front of you and fired 8 Round
from an AR style assault rifle shooting you in the ear
take a look what happened
experts said frankly you shouldn't be here right now experts said a kill shot was almost a certainty but yet
hear you
you had to have asked yourself
you had to have reflected on this how am I here
and why am I here
how do you answer that
it's a very hard one to
when it happened
it was a
I said something's going on there it was a real
to
you're not thinking about that
and I was lucky I went down quickly because I didn't go down quickly bullets were coming right over my head when I was down I heard them they were they were moving along
they move pretty fast
how fast does a bullet go they said about 3,000 Mi an hour that's
they gave it to me in feet and then they gave it to me and I said no no I want to know in miles per hour
and it's more than 3,000 Mi an hour and you hear it you hear the whipping sound
I was lucky in that regard but the big luck was cuz that's something you can control you go down quickly if you don't go down quickly have a problem
but the big thing was to turn that it was only the turn it had to be a perfect 90Â° turn or you would have been I wouldn't be with you today
and I had to be looking at something to the right and the people we had massive crowds and they were in
so there was no reason to be looking to the right you had no people right or
do you know the graph my all-time favorite graph showing my great numbers on immigration stopping immigration virt
at the border which is a big subject
and I was very proud of that crap but they only use it about 20% of the time it's always on my left and it's always at the end
of my
I mean like the very beginning it was on my right
so if you add it all up it's like
21 millions of the
and I just see it on television again
today just before I came in
big on the screen again today
in finding out you know I have the endorsement of the NRA but
I don't know
I have no knowledge of guns like as an example I have two sons that have extreme knowledge a great
and Don and Eric both told me separately
that's a guaranteed shot for a bad
from that distance 130 yd sounded
a long way away as a shooter that's a very close Target
they said to related to me they said it would be like syncing a one foot
and I said that's not good
so why were you spared you've had to reflect on this alone and middle of the night at the golf cart riding down the way thinking about it
how do you answer why were you
so
had to be some great power
cuz you just can't say Millions to 1 million I used to say a million to one it's much more than that because
again
it has to be a reason to go right and I never go right there's no
and not only go right it's for
1/8 of a second
it's out of all the time that we're on this planet it's 1/8 of a second right
so I should be with you
is there a purpose
was there a reason you think you were
I mean the only thing I can
is that God loves our country and he thinks we're going to bring our country back he wants to bring it back it's so bad right now what's happening when you look at the crime
the horrible things that are happening inside our country and it can be solved it can be solved fairly quickly
it has to be God
how do you say
when it's you know
it's just not possible that I was in that position it's the only position where that bullet could have missed and you believe in God
I Do I Do You Believe God's hand was in this that day I believe so yeah
and you talk about the country
you believe you have more to do you weren't done you were spared for a reason
well God believes that
I guess we'll have to see number one I'm in an election with
very vicious group of people
I won the election against Biden I
by 17 or 18 points after the debate
and they said you know what he's going to lose they went and told him he's going to lose and we're going to change you out and he said no I'm not going to do it in fact he said only God will change me
so who knows what happened there but he said
I'm not leaving you ain't got 14 million vot
Kamala got done zero she ran against him she got zero she never made it to Iowa which is the first
and here she is she's on the other side
but you know it's like nobody ever had this before you have an opponent in politics you have an opponent and you win or you
but you don't have an appointment and then you're doing well against the opponent they take him out they give you a new opponent they give you a nice fresh op
and so I have to win that
and if I win that that would really serve to say that if there's
incredible power up there
wanted me to
be involved in Saving and maybe it's more than saving the nation maybe it's saving the world you know I get along with all those stuff guys
and Russia wouldn't have gone into Ukrainian have a million people living right now you'd have cities all over Ukraine I mean these magnificent cities with the domes and the golden domes and
it'll be up there right now demolish so many of those cities of the country is just Dem
Israel would never happen October 7th would have never happened
Iran was
and I don't want them to be broke but I don't want them to have a nuclear weapon so you think you're meant to take those challenges on you're meant to serve in that way
I don't know I mean I don't know in thinking about it it's
it's beyond any of us I guess to really know that
but I can say that
for that
to have gone along this path right here
for that bullet to have gone along that
and
the top of my ear
as opposed to any other place would have been no good
critically injured to others
who thought they weren't going to make it you know
doctor said they will not make it and they did
did the doctors were incredible you've been
I can't even involved with those families and I understand a lot of support and help for those families this taken place
well we gave a friend of mine who's
pretty rich
was very moved by what happened
and he said do you mind if I
Corey golden Corey everyone calls him Corey now firefighter great firefighter fire
of a small town volunteer right volunteer no substantial money obviously you know they live they live comfortably they love each other they have a great family beautiful family actually
and I
good what do you want to give you set a million dollars he wrote out a check right in front of me for a million dollars
we presented it to the left that's more money than
have you ever even thought about
but on top of that we raised close to 6 million dollars
and gofund
and that's going to be split
we're doing it now
obviously with Corey's family
more the other two made it and they're going to be in good
I can't stress how good those doctors were it was going to be three
and it turned out to be
but they were hit
they're going to be getting
probably close to a million and a half dollars
how do you feel about the Secret Service
send the jobs
they were very brave because when those bullets were
coming at me and you
I was down
cuz I went down quickly fortunately otherwise because the Bulls were going right over my head
so that was another thing but yeah I don't talk about that is that was a question of going down
the other was a question you had to be an exact perfect position and it's almost impossible to
achieve that
you have to be right you have to have to use the graph in the whole thing is just so crazy
you never use it at the beginning of this beach never I've never used at the beginning
pull down the graph and I look over at the graph and I get
sound like a bolting deer Don my son Don said it's like a bolting deer great shots
a bolting deer they shoot simultaneously with the deer bolting it bolts for some reason
I guess that was my
it was it was absolutely amazing but the Secret Service
obviously somebody should have been another roof you
what is the roof was
and there was a lack of communication between
law enforcement
and Secret Service it seems to be coming
so they're going to have to work that out I can say this on stage we had
great br
because bullets were coming at me
and they were coming right on top of me and within about 3 or 4 seconds I was covered with
had the sniper
and it may have been somebody else in addition may have been a local police
shot
I don't know
but had that shot not been made from a long distance much longer
and hit its Target one
then they would have been dead probably because they would have been a pile and he would have been shooting into the
and in addition you would have had a lot of people killed this could have been like that Las Vegas disaster
horrible human being killed a lot of people at a
has this changed
does it change your appreciation for life has it changed anything about you did you did you have your kids extra hard I mean is it changed you a lot of people ask me and a lot of people say like
have you developed any fear
doing
cuz you look big president is a dangerous
it's much more dangerous than a race car driver than anything is probably the most dangerous profession of you think about it just go up and down the
if 46
numerous left early
or got
it's a very dangerous job it's
I never realized how dangerous but I was at the border yesterday
they were
the dangerous place he allowed it
he and her allowed it to become dangerous
it's a very very dangerous place
I was doing an interview in secret service that sir
no more standing up they don't they don't want me to stand up you know people
especially with the kind of weapons they have today people have shots
but it is it's an interesting
it's a great job it's an interesting job you can do so much good but it's a dangerous
you
you may have been
spare to
and to do that as president of the United States you have to defeat
Kamala Harris on November 5th
what do you think of her as a person what do you think of Carla Harris as a person just personally what I don't know her
you get to know people when you watch
television or when you see them and read them and
she's
wanted to defund the police very
bailed out a lot of people in Minnesota from jails who did some really bad things
I saw that very loud and clear then when that took place
lot of bad things I mean she spent a lot of bad things there will be no fracking there will be no drillings and she doesn't want to drill which will mean our country is going to shrivel up and die
you can't run
the country without fossil fuel at least not for quite a while because you don't have
you don't have the power they don't have the power you don't have all sorts of nice Contraptions but they don't have Windows fine but
it kills the bird it's the birds that destroys the fields
destroys it feels what it does you know how economists
when does the most expensive energy in the world
the environmentalist love and why do they love it it kills all the birds walk to the bottom of a windmill and take a look at looks like a bird semut
but you need the fossil fuel she's totally against
and you know politicians when they're against something early that's what
that's where they're going to be and if she got in she would not allow fracking in Pennsylvania she will not allow drilling all over the place the only reason she's allowing it now
they were ending everything and all of a sudden prices started to go up through the roof and they say go back to the Trump policy for a little
but if she won this election she'd go to things that won't work
the green new scam I
and it'll be very bad I think
I think she'd be worse than Biden and Biden was the worst president in the history of our
she's going down as the worst vice president I mean she was known
5 weeks ago
she was known as a
she was known as a
terrible vice president
he left that stuff
they wanted him out but they didn't want her
they would have done anything to get anybody on the list you know that a list
10
and they put her on the list and she came in 11th she was the last on the list actually
in terms of
professionalism in terms of everything else then all of a sudden they realize that's not going to be politically acceptable
they didn't want to do it they didn't have the guts to make that move
and they ended up with her and then the fake news media of course got right behind
at this moment
if she can do no wrong but if you follow politics and if you see what she said she'll destroy this country with her tax increases and everything else you don't have anything against her personally know you're just talking about her values and her you don't know her I don't know her I don't
these are things that she said then
what did she say in different things now about
fracking and that sort of thing because
the things you're saying she said
I've heard her say those things in the past but is she saying different things now
a lot of things I would say 95 maybe almost 100%
it's totally different she's like my policy
energy and there's you know we were energy independent
4 years ago today it's a whole different story
her everything's
she's gone from
no fracking under any circumstances we're not talking a long time ago we're talking about 3 years ago
and we're talking about when she was running
she was when she was running against Biden and I guess
close to 22 people she was the first one to leave she was out
she did very bad
she was the last out of 22 and now she's the one
is running
and she's getting she's getting a free press
our
when you examine it was very bad for our country she's going to raise taxes tremendously she's going to force companies out of our country
you know these are great International companies they don't have to be here they can be another countries you know that better than anybody
and if other countries may be in Europe or other places
I'm going to say we're going to charge you 10% tax and the us is going to be at 54% when you
local and state taxes
I mean they get paid for how much money they make it's a simple business very simple business how much money
is the company
and if you're going to have to pay 54% here
you're done you're going to move to another country to have some very nice countries to live in
and they're very loyal to their shareholders they almost have an obligation to do
so she's going to chase a lot of companies out of our country with what she's talking
you've been Commander in Chief
she's been commander-in-chief On the Border
as commander in
how would you
greater paper on the border well I would say an F I mean
in terms of Madness if you're going to look for how to run a water bad
it's it's a market study
what you shouldn't be doing
it's the worst Border in history
I believe we have 20 million people that came in and you've heard this before they come in from
jails in prison they've come in from mental institutions if you know that that's here that's your world a little bit isn't
and their Terr
are they coming from but they are allowing other countries are allowing their jail population to pour into our country they're bringing them
and they're saying if you come back we will kill you
if you come back we will give you the death battle
and they're dropping murderers and drug dealers and human traffickers into our country
by the hundreds of thousands who's doing
the countries are doing
Venezuela
lot of South American countries probably all of them hey you do it so what
if I'm the president of
country in South America what anywhere in the world it's happening now all over the world
they're coming from Africa the Cong
we had the border patrol yesterday I was there
border
tell me they have as of this moment
158
represent
most people don't even know there are that many
158 countries over the last year
a represent
crossing the border illegally they're coming in from Mexico
they're coming in from all over the world they're going through Mexico
and Mexico shouldn't be allowing it but they are they wouldn't
they didn't allow it when I was there I was very strong with we had a remain in Mexico policy
what are you going to do day one with these countries that have gotten into our country
illegally between ports of Entry what are you going to do with those people we are going to
have a mass deportation of criminals immediately the Crim
are border patrol ice and local police know every one of them
they know their middle names they know them
I know you okay they know I'm very well they know the bad ones and they know the ones that aren't so bad
but the local police have to be given their Authority back because we're in a crime-ridden nation
we have if you take the top 25 cities interestingly they're almost all run by democrats
cash
you have no you don't have to put up any cash you're a murder
can you get
and you leave you don't have to put up cash there's no bond no nothing
it's crazy what's happening
it's almost as though they hate our country
and they wanted to
if these people are rounded up and deported
then this will be a mass
and what they'll do is they'll pick out of the
100,000 people that
I have to go quickly because
you know Murder is prisoners from
tough
criminals look like nice people nice
MS-13 gang members they love cutting people they love cutting up people cutting people
they did it in a Long Island a lot of them on Long Island I got I got
thousands of them taken out during my Administration
and they didn't come back in the country's new you send them
no more money you know we give so much money so stupidly to everybody
I said you do that I said
Honduras El Salvador
guatemal
Mexico to an extent Mexico
they didn't let him come in they were stopping them
I was doing things to Mexico that you wouldn't believe I said you stopped them and you have to stop them on your Southern border meaning on the other side before they get into your country
not after they make that track you have to stop them before they get in
and it was working we had the best Border in the history of our country
Biden could have gone to the beach all he had to do is let them
continue to work and we had the best water we've ever had that was the chart that was the famous chart that I said I fell in love with you and I love that
I wouldn't be here if it was over there yet but we had the best
at any
in recorded history
and now we have the worst Border in the history of the world
20 million people but I think it's much more than that 20 million you know they say it was only 15 million what is
it's over 20
and many of those people are vicious
kill
and they're living in our country they're coming
and you know nothing good is going to happen
we have massive numbers of terrorists we used to watch that so closely
we had one year where border patrol
2019 border patrol said I had none
Tara is coming to the country now I don't even believe that you know it's almost impossible to do that you can't know who got away you don't know
now we have thousands of terrorist
in a country and you know from a man of great common sense I love you
you know that that's not going to end
what's going to end really badly for our country we have to get them out I know there are things that you are not in favor of this
ballot harvesting
this mail-in ballot all of this but those are the rules of the game right now
is Republican party going to play that game better than the Democrats or are they going to be complaining about it and get beat at the game with the rules that are in play right now it shouldn't be allowed
a whole different mindset but it is
Republicans like to go there on Tuesday and vote in person and that's been for you know for a long time many years decades
it's a custom almost it's a family custom it's a beautiful thing
the Democrats play a different game
you a ballot harvesting but you also have
getting ballots
in California you have people getting seven ballots
Democrats
for instance I Look at California I gave a speech I had so I had a crowd so big I said there's no way I could lose
California but automatically they mark it down if you're a republican is a
can you lose by 5 million votes I said 5 million votes I guarantee
if Jesus came down
and was the vote counter I would win California okay
in other words if we had an honest vote counter or really honest about
I do great with the Hispanics
I mean at a level that no Republicans ever done
but if we had an honest vote count
I would win California
they have Trump signs all over
it's a very dish
everything is
they send out 38,000,000 I think it is around 36
minion ballots they
you know when you go into a good place because we have a lot of honest to be honest places too you got to the Midwest you go to
Iowa Idaho places
they wouldn't even think about it it's a very honest
think of
38 million they don't have a voting
but when you go in even in Florida I went into vote in Palm Beach
they know who I am but
sir may I see you this may I see you that may I see your card man they look at you they everything
I said it would be really very tough
in California
and you're supposed to send it back
so that has to go through a mailman it has to go through all these different things and many people and I'm sure you've heard this many people get
many more than one
if those are the rules you have
then should the Republicans
play hard under those rules the Republicans should have played much harder over the years and this is 10-12 years ago it started
France had mail in ballots
they went away from him because people were
anytime you have a mail-in ballot there's going to be massive
Jimmy cart
who's the happiest man alive today because
his administration is brilliant by comparison
Harris
I don't even know where he's like at a beach some place in California
but Jimmy cart
was put in charge of a study commissioned with some very dignified people very
highly regarded people senators
retired
and the primary conclusion was you can't have male in Balance if you have mail-in ballots that will be cheating
and this is Jimmy cart
100
but we have to do is get control and then we have to change
and it's a very simple change
same day vot
everybody wants you know remember the old days everybody would go is it Tuesday you go you
even if you declare a holiday a voting holiday which would
but importantly paper ballots
no machines that go up to space
whatever happens happens
voter ID
did Democrats don't want voter ID and proof of citizenship you have to be a citizen but we want to very important Supreme Court case
essentially you have to be a citizen to register
what's a big
because they're registered they're trying to register people
that just came into our country from the border from the open bord
you can't have open borders and you have to have
great elections in other words you need borders to have a country that's a great country you need bord
and you need Fair elections
you ran against Biden for a while then you switched and are now running against Kamala Harris
was there a cover
how about Biden not being confident and how wide was this cover how wide did this have to be
what's the media involved we saw people going
on television and others say I meet with him everyday he's sharp he's a bull he's doing this and I think everybody determined and it's not his fault for aging that's just part of the problem it's not his fault for aging
wondering was there a cover-up how many people were involved
was there a conspiracy here I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist but was there a conspiracy
and who was involved in it and if there was a kind of conspiracy how do you trust those people going forward we're just to make people feel better that are a certain
I know many people that
that is 939495
a good example is somebody like Bernie Marcus he's 95 years old founder of Home Depot
and I was with him not so long ago look I'm in a certain point
I know many many people in their late eighties that
really
old you know in terms of what we're talking about the age difference
it was really
manaf
during the debate we had the debate did the debate
the highest rated debate ever so I think people are really may be looking to see if there's any truth to that
the ratings are not debate
through the
I think I perform very well
but he didn't perform
and it was
that was the beginning of the end
then he tried to go on various shows to show
mental acuity so
then he didn't do very well and they were all set ups George slobber topless
they
like setups in other words easy questions like
what's your favorite dessert do you like vanilla ice cream and stuff they were
and he didn't do
goodbye goodbye
but it really started with the
and then a pole came out the Democrats had to pull that showed I was up 1 7.
they went to admit they said you were going to lose you saw that where they said you're going to lose you can't win anymore you're going to lose
and we want you out Nancy Pelosi went I know the whole thing because I know people on the other side you have some very good friends on the other side hard to believe isn't
and they went to him and they said we want you out and we can do it the nice way
or the hard
and we can use
the
25th Amendment
we can use
the 24th Amendment
we can use all sorts of amendments and get you the hell out it was nasty
it was very nasty
and he was very angry
But ultimately he said
it's going to have to leave
and then they gave him his niece a way out but he was very angry about it and you know what he
if you go back 25 years he was not the Char
but he did win the primaries say what you want to get 14 million but she got no votes she never even made it to Iowa
14 million V
have you talked to him since he stepped down I really don't talk to him
I've always been sort of angry you know we talked about Secret
he always made it very tough for us to have the proper number of Secret Service
I don't know
whose fault it is but I will tell you
I have these massive rallies
50 60,000 people are
are people always fighting to
security
Secret Service and he knew
that we didn't have enough
and he'd have a rally of three or four people I mean nobody would go if he had a rally if if he had 20 people who was a lot nobody would go
did stand on the road and look for people to try
be there like you had somebody behind
and yet he had a massive contingent of Secret Service
and I know that they wanted to have
his people come over to these big rallies that I was having
and I know that it was a very tough situation so you know when this happened
people would ask whose fault is it I think to a certain extent it's Biden's fault and Harrison
I'm the opponent look they will weaponizing government
against
they brought in the whole doj to try and get me
they weren't too interested in my health and safety
I would be if I were in that position but they weren't very interested but they
they were always making
from what I understood and and I could feel it
they were making it very difficult to have
proper Staffing in terms of Secret Service
I'm not saying that they wanted you to get shot but do you think
it was okay with them if you did
I don't know I mean I don't know is a lot of
I don't know why
I had a great president
who had the best economy we've ever had
we had job numbers that were unbelievable
and then you had bounced back jobs you know the jobs after a pandemic is it all pandemics whatever you have something like that
an
you have a bounce back as it gets better you bounce
they like to try and claim those jobs but those are
we had a tremendous present we rebuilt the military we knocked out Isis I had no war
so many things we did largest tax cuts ever
which is what gave us the great economy by the way largest regulation Cuts we were we were choking with regul
but you know when you do things like that
the other side
that disagrees with that or for whatever reason doesn't want to do it
a lot of hatred is Jenner
give me an example that
I'm a threat to democ
no they're a threat they've weaponized government
but that turned to be like one of their lines you know
Trump is a threat I'm not a threat to democracy at
they are threat to democracy but they would say that that was standard line just keep saying
and
that can get
assassins
what potential assassins going that's a terrible thing I used to say
and you
who's the standard line for them Donald Trump is a threat to democracy I'm just the op
I'm the one
fixture military I'm the one that knocked out Isis I'm the
I did so much I also took a
maybe that brother is because of their rhetoric you know it's really nasty right
Democratic Convention my name is mentioned hundreds of times
the consequences
of putting Donald Trump
back in the White House are extremely serious the Border was mentioned like once
inflation wasn't mentioned at
they barely talked about the economy
they didn't talk about crime at all
they didn't talk about the invasion of our country
you know we're being invaded by millions of people this is worse than an arm
at least an army you know how you can fight
whipping invaded these people
are invading it's an invasion of our country they didn't talk about that and yet my name is mentioned
300
she mentioned my name I guess 19 times in Her speech alone
19
they demonize you a lot
make a big deal out of the fact that you said you're only going to have to vote one time you like me you're going to have to vote
one
forever or whatever your quote was beautiful I love you get out you got to get out and vote in 4 years you don't have to vote again we'll have it fixed so good you're not going to have to
and with a
Christians for whatever reason don't vote very much you know proportionately
NRA people and people that
feel very strongly about the Second Amendment they're not
I don't know why maybe it's a rebellious
and I said to the Christian
we going to win this election
if we win this election I'll straighten everything out in less than 4 years by
then you don't have to it doesn't matter in other words I'm saying you don't have to
but you have to vote this time
because we have to wear this is the most important election
in the history of our country but you're right they took that you don't have to
and it's not going to be important for you to come
we're not going to need you voted but we need the votes
Christians have to get out
gun own
they don't vote and gun owners have to get out
so you didn't mean vote me in once cuz I ain't ever leaving your meaning
this is an important one vote this time of course that's what I meant and I said it and everybody knows I said it that way
and everybody agrees that I said that
I don't know if they have I hope they have it on tape but if they
I'll be a dick
and sometimes when they do it they don't say why
and I said jokingly on Sean Hannity is a great guy
I said no
I want to be a dictator for one day
because I'm going to get
going with drill baby drill
and I'm going to strengthen the borders to a level like you've never seen I only want to be and after that I'll never be a
so I said it nicely I said and I said
one
because I
do the energy
and I want to strengthen the Border one day
and it was said with a chuckle the audience laughed I laughed we all
but they take it and they cut
I want to be a dictator
these are very dishonest people that were dealing with a very dishonest people bad people
so you say that was taken out of
well all you have to do is watch it I mean so many things are Charlottesville was taken out of
very fine people on both sides
Jenna Joe
since I ran because of Charlottesville I saw the veins bulging out of their
and I have my statement which was fine but if they let the next sentence run it was perfect
when she spoke she said I was going to raise taxes now I'm lowering tax
she said all sorts of things that were false everything was
I think we could count to 21
I'm going to
save Social Security they're going to destroy Social Security because the millions of people that are pouring in are going on Social Security Social Security cannot stand
was I'm leaving Social Security
just the way it is I'm not raising age limits I'm not doing anything
they're going to destroy it they're going to destroy Medicare I mean more importantly they're going to destroy our
if she wins I don't believe our country has a chance
because it's a Marxist ideology
and if you go back three or four years
and you look at the statements even running for office
she was Raising her hand for every
you can't have any personal insurance personal life insurance or any form of insurance
you have to be in a big government pool
PetSmart
in other words if you want to have insurance you worked
you want to pay more and have a great insurance plan health insurance
she doesn't want you to have
this was only a few years ago that's where she's
her father is a Marxist professor
and that's where she's
and our country will never be ready for that our country won't be able to have
some people say that this election is going to be determined by
15 counties in 11 states 11 of them into seven states one of them here in Nevada where we are right now one of them in Arizona Maricopa County two of them in Texas Tarrant County or Fort Worth is where Merritt Street Media is
1074
Cobb County in Georgia County in Pennsylvania one in Michigan
because of Independence there
if there are Independents watching this right now
and trying to decide
which way to jump off the fence
to the Harris side of the fence
or to the Trump side of the fence
what do you say to them
to make it clear
why they should vote
for Donald J Trump for president
you saw that this morning and buy a lot by like nine points that's considered a
and for whatever reason it's harder for a republican to lead with Independence you know the Republican route is a hard
do you have to win that whole East Coast
they start off with a certain number
whether you like it or not
that's the way it is
the welfare the Civil Service the Union
no I actually think the unions are coming with me when I say the unions the workers the people within those unions
I could say that the United Auto Workers has done a terrible job
at
and I'm going to get far more votes
she's going to
I think a lot of the unions are voting for me and they did last time they did both
what I say is this we need a safe country we need a wealthy country we need a country that's going to take care of its people we need great schooling we need great military
we need everything everything is broken now I rebuilt the military they left 85 billion dollars of
in Afghan
in the most embarrassing day I mean as an example they didn't talk about Afghanistan last night why didn't they talk about the single most embarrassing day in the history of our country
we're going to have a country that's run with strong borders and pure beautiful election
we're going to be energy dominant not just independent we're going to dominate an energy you know we have more liquid
under our feet than any other country including Saudi Arabia and Russ
will be doubling and tripling them
and we're going to start paying down debt we owe 35 trillion dollars okay which she also didn't mention
will be paying down
we're going to make America great
I created the greatest economy in the history of our country just prior to covid we are the greatest economy in the history then we had to go back
and we had a watch be careful because we would have ended up in 1929
and then they came in and they spent money
I like a bunch of really
foolish
and a created tremendous inflation and I had no inflation I had almost just about perfect but
almost no inflation
turn the entire
and then inflation went to record numbers
and they say 21% but it's much more than that they don't include
and yesterday you saw something else
they created 818,000 jobs that will affect
they did that because they thought they'd have that before the election
they turn out to be fake they had a whistleblower a leak
that said know it's wrong in Department of Labor
and 818 almost a million jobs are
they created and then they created crimes
they said the crime stats were so good
play the FBI and you know what happened they didn't include certain areas like little areas like Chicago
like other cities that are crime
and that was done by the FBI in order to make
the crime numbers look better
we're going to turn this country around the country is very sick right now it's very
we're going to turn it around we're going to make America great again and we're going to do it rather rapidly but we also
we're stuck with a problem now that's a big problem
we have Mill
Criminal
that have been allowed into
when I talked to voters and I've looked at polls that said this Rasmussen looks at these he's on Merritt Street
they say they're concerned about affordability
we need to be able to afford tennis shoes for their kids mom that has three boys in school and she says like your feet grow during the night I need to buy tennis shoes you know for the kids every couple of weeks inflation has killed and they're saying they're printing money so fast that the dollars I have buy last because they're printing money so
they say second they're worried about Safety and Security primarily the Border that's an important thing for them they talk about that they say they're concerned about
abortion and it's a distant third but it's it's
I've done a great favor and I don't want to go over the whole thing because you don't have enough time
but I brought that into a land where everybody can finally after 52 years get along with the taking votes in various States right now
in summer coming out in a very liberal way much different like Ohio and Kansas
we've done an amazing thing there and
that's a much softer issue than it was
a little while ago but you know this has been an issue abortion has been an issue Roe v
for 52 years they've tried to get it back into the states and I got it back into the states that means Democrats Republicans liberals conserv
and all legal scholar
it was always wrong being in the federal government I got it
back in the States and now there's voting taking place
I believe in exceptions like Ronald Reagan believed and exceptions very important for life of the mother
rape in
but I will tell you that is
that's something that's it's very interesting how it's working
it had to be done
because it was ripping our country
so RFK Jr has offered his support to you and your campaign
and not defeat that I'm suspending
my campaign activ
I'm out again with President Trump and his family members I was surprised to discover
that we are online on medication
and those meetings he suggested that we joined forces as a Unity party
how do you feel about that I'm very honored by it and he's a very smart guy a different kind of a guy
you're very
loves our country
Nas
I think very good views on a lot of different things
and I've known her for a long time we've been
someone friendly actually
and I think he's going to be a great asset I think he has a lot to the election he's got a good following tremendous follow
I think he has a lot to the election and I think he adds a lot to
if we win I mean he's got some very interesting ideas and good ideas I think he'll be
a fantastic
and influential person
in terms of
getting this country back on
I think
if we win
I think you can be very valuable to the country and
I think you can also help us
build up the margins you know you were talking about votes some people say this could be a landslide too you know they could say it would be a land
and it's not going to be a landslide on this side it could be a landslide on our side it won't be a landslide on
it should be a landslide because she will destroy the country she's going to destroy the
look at the job she did at the border she was a bulldozer just look at the job
in history there's never been a mess like that
and now they have their standard line you know they're great for misinformation
she's got a standard
we did a wonderful job at the border and she'll say it 100 times a thousand
a lot of people that driving cab
is there accountants
doctors they're not into politics like you are I know how much you are the fact is
100 times and they think that maybe people will start to believe what she's done to this country
and she this is beyond
because she was in charge of the border and that's the way she'll run
will he have a role in your Administration he's very experienced trial law
and a lot of it environmental so you know he might
play Roll environmentally you might play A Rose Attorney General there's a lot of things he could offer to the administration is a very smart guy welcome your support
but I've always had a good relationship with
and I'm very honored by his
will I have spoken to him about you in the past and he's always spoken of you with a great deal of respect even though you guys have been campaigning against each other he's always spoken to you with a great deal of respect so it's not surprising to me that he supports you so that wasn't a surprise to me well one thing he said to me and he said the same thing that I say to everybody November 5th is going to be the most important day in the history of our country I believe that I think it's there hasn't been an election like this for generations to be sure Mr President thank you so much
