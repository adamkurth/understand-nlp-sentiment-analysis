welcome one at all to The Late Show I'm your host Stephen Colbert ladies and gentlemen thank you thank you for being here for a very special night at The Late Show we were supposed to be off tonight
this wasn't supposed to be showing us my plan was to be in sweatpants right now
with a clutch of peanut butter pretzels in one hand and a jar of Nutella in the other slowly slipping into a flavor comma
our 8 of a below deck Med Marathon
but instead we fired up the old show machine for one night only
for a very important reason it's Matt Damon's birthday happy birthday Matt thank you buddy Matt I got you what you wanted an interview with vice president comma Harris you're welcome
the stage here at the Ed Sullivan she's been on six times 6 times 7 if you count when she was on to promote her acoustic album when we folk we win
but this is her first appearance as the Democratic nom
in the last few days she's appeared on
Howard Stern
the
plus Ink Master the Mandalorian and explaining the child tax credit on
and it's just not
it's not just TV and radio Harris wants to meet the online
so she's also doing interviews with influencers
wait a second
does that mean I'm an influencer what am I young now with all these appearances Harris is trying to connect with younger voters black and Latino audiences and older Americans
I think I know which demographic we represent I said I think I know which demographic we represent Alan Alan turn up the volume Alan it's the up arrow on the remote know that's the channel button and he's gone he's gone
as part of her appeal
to young women Harris also did an interview on the podcast call her daddy
which is which is I'm being told sex positive
Mega popular and the most listened to podcast by
that is until the upcoming release of a microphone next to Glen Powell Ave the host of call her daddy Alex Cooper who I assume is the the daddy
ask Harris about an insulting comment at a recent Town Hall made by Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee
I saw the governor of Arkansas said my kids keep me humble
unfortunately Kamala Harris doesn't have anything keeping her humble
how did that make you feel
I don't think she understands
that there are a whole lot of women out here
who won arnaut aspiring to be humble
humble with wanting to be the most powerful person in the world hey I'm sorry to bug you and totally no worries if not I was just wondering if I could if it's okay maybe control America's nuclear Arsenal or is that crazy oh my God forget I said anything I'm sorry I'm sorry talk about
and that's what's so outrageous about it is a bunch of these guys up in the state capitals are writing these decisions
because they somehow have decided that they're in a better position to tell you what's in your best interest than you are to know what's in your own best interest
it's outrageous I mean Daddy getting to put it
are Tik Tok terms I have seen girls on the street walk up to men and B
do you know where a tampon goes do you know how many tampons we use and they don't know the answer yes we do
we all know how many tampons you
Stella stay with me one at a time 100 a Baker's Dozen a murder of tampons
in preparation for this evening we went out we learned a little bit about the vice president's bio turns out she was the first African-American first woman and first Asian-American to become the Attorney General of California and she attended law school she attended Law School in San Francisco where she lived with her sister Maya and helped her potty train my his daughter
when talking about the experience Harris said I'm dealing with this brutal stuff dog eat dog in school and then I would come home and we would all stand by the toilet and wave by to a piece of and if she wins next month we all get to have the same experience personal
and The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by CS Lewis her favorite movie is My Cousin Vinny and when it comes to music she said this the best rapper alive
I knew it Tupac is still alive yeah I told you and the government is hiding him in Area 51 where he's spitting bars with bigfoots of course one story
what story that really should be a non-political story that were all watching with great concern
is Hurricane
a now Category 5 storm
it is turning straight toward the west coast of Florida and I hope everyone in Tampa
is no longer in Tampa
please heed your Mare and get to safety because meteorologists are saying mil
could be a once in a century storm
communities in the path of Helene are still in desperate need of Aid if you can please follow this QR code right here or go to colbertlateshow.com / hurricane Helene we've got some suggested organizations on the ground that you can donate to
to help these people in desperate
I'll tell you who's not
Donald
he's out there spreading a bunch of lies that he thinks they're good for him because him is all he thinks about
in the past week Trump has falsely claimed that there are no helicopters or rescue operations in North Carolina falsely claimed that Kamala Harris spent all her FEMA money on housing illegal migrants and if those lies aren't bad enough Trump's Toadies have also been recruiting robots to help them lie one image that's been making the rounds is this picture of trump waiting into floodwaters
with First Responders now turns out
that's an AI
if you look closely you can tell because in the picture Donald Trump is helping people also you got to you got to have an iPhone also he knows it's very important to never get his hair wet
or feed it after midnight
the oldest AI is emotional manipulation for political ends and it's effective because there are thousands of real people in trouble right now and Americans have a
but this is just
for instance the most popular fake image being spread by prominent Republicans who definitely know better
shows a scared little girl with a puppy in a flood zone one Mega blogger posted that fake image with the caption our government has failed us again yes they fail that imaginary girl
this is just as bad as when Biden did nothing to help this woman save her drowning boyfriend I hear I hear all the two person doors were being used by illegal immigrants
this weekend Trump held another life vest in Pennsylvania
and it was joined on stage by Elon
that that's got to be a little confusing for Trump voters I'm fighting for the little guy and you know how much I hate immigrants now please welcome an immigrant who makes more money in one second and you'll make in your entire worthless lives put your filthy little worker hands together for yourself African Olive Garden Elon Musk period
here's Trump introducing Elan who enters the stage with Grace and his rocket company is the only reason we can now send American astronauts into space bats that's one small step for man
one weird little hop for a douchebag so so okay so okay Elon may enter the stage in a little
but at least he shakes hands like a normal oh my God
he looks like Igor greeting the doordash guy we got a great show for you tonight coming up vice president Kamala Harris

my guest tonight is the Democratic nominee for president of the United States please welcome back to the Late Show vice president Kamala Harris presidential that I've got here but before we do anything I want to
I want to I want to talk about the recovery
from Hurricane Helene and in the light of the fact that hurricane Milton has strengthened once again
to a category 5 hurricane and it's
for the West Coast
of Florida you were down in Georgia and North Carolina who are still in the midst of a massive cleanup and rescue and Recovery effort still what what do people need to know
well first of all to all of those folks in North Carolina and Georgia please know that FEMA and the people on the ground are there to help you you are entitled to help
there's a lot of misinformation
and I beseech you I beg you to please not pay attention to it because there are a whole lot of folks who are there to give you help and Aid in terms of the immediate aftermath and what people need to do in terms of getting through the height of this emergency and this crisis but also in terms of long-term
and that means applying for it knowing that the services are there
hurricane Helene
I'm not a woman in Georgia
who just days before lost her husband
because a tree fell on their house and kill
and I met she and her daughter
days after he died and what just upsets me so is the idea that
any politician
would play political games with these folks with people who are in the midst of such suffering
loss of life loss of their homes loss of normal
and then for the sake of political gain tell these lies
in a way that is meant to make people distrust
the help that is there for them to receive it
is something we have to say look at some point
we have to work together and I'll tell you there are plenty of leaders who are working in a bipartisan way I've talked to govern
of both parties were working in a bipartisan way to get the aid to people on the ground and and I'm going to continue to do it doing what's right and they should be commended they should be commended this kind of manipulation is as a cynical and corrupt luxury
the suffering of other people
have you know
if you purport to be a leader to understand that being a leader means lifting people up in a time of need
tonight
the hurricane that is about to hit Florida is extremely sir
and is predicted to be historic and proportion in terms of the damage it will cause and I know there are a lot of tough Floridians
wait it out many hurricanes and may think that they can do the same with this one this one's going to be different and so I asked anybody who is watching if you are in Florida and the predicted path
of this hurricane if you got a family member who might be you know thinking they can wait it out please get in touch with him tell him it's not going to be like the ones we've seen before
please follow your local leaders instructions and if they're telling you to evacuate grab your stuff and get out
now your your campaign is one of the short
in modern history does it feel
it's definitely been a whirlwind I mean it's I think
but somewhere around 70 days that we've been in it and and so there's a lot of catching up to do you know my opponent the former president has been running
20
I'm traveling around the country I'm spending a lot of time talking with folks listening to folks and
the one thing I can report back from the field if you will is that
people are exhausted by that old tired Playbook of Donald Trump's they really are and and even if they voted for him even if they voted for him in the past there are a lot of folks who are just saying you know enough of the rhetoric that's about trying to divide the country and have Americans Point their fingers at each other you know folks are ready to turn the page it's like let's
start a new way forward and and what I'm saying is that a lot of Americans regardless of their party republicans Democrats Independence
they're ready for a new generation of leadership
that is about
Solutions and common sense in finding common ground and
and that is what I am off
no later on Joe Biden step the side make room for you and I don't I don't like to brag about this but ever since you became the nominee you and I have been texting every day you usually send me a text like Hey Stephen it's comma OK Google
it's it's Family TV right it starts with a w there's a letter between and then the end the last letters asked your economic plan includes a small business tax credits A Child Care credits down payment assistance and other things people will talk about one of the ways that you want to help pay for some of that is to have billionaires pay their fair share in Texas who support you you are from Northern California after all where they grow in fields out there who is your favorite billionaire because we all have a favorite billionaire on three one two three open I'm sorry we have to agree that teachers and firefighters and nurses should not be paying a higher tax rate than billionaires in the biggest corporations for creating wealth good for you you work hard you create well for you and your family good for you I am a capitalist
but look I'm also a devout public servant I know the limitations of government but I also know that we need to make sure that we that everyone is paying their fair share so that
we can do the work of extending as I intend to do the child tax credit to $6,000 for the first year of a child's life because that young family could use that money to buy a car seat to buy a crib what we need to do to bring down the cost of Health Care in America we've kept the cost of insulin for our seniors at 35.00% for all Americans they're paying too much more vice president
get on here for the Democratic nominee for president vice presidents Kamala Harris Madam vice president thanks so much thanks so much for for dropping by this evening polling shows that a lot of people especially independent voters really want this to be a change election and that they tend to break for you in terms of thinking about change you are a member of President Administration
under a Harris Administration
what would the major changes be and what would say the same
sure well I mean I'm obviously not Joe Biden and so that would be one change in terms of but also I think it's important to say with you know 28 days to go I'm not Donald Trump
end and so when we think about the significance of what this next generation of leadership looks like where I'd be elected president
it is about
frankly I love the American people and I believe in our country
I love that it is our character in nature
to be an Ambit
you know we we have aspirations we have dreams we are
we we have incredible work ethic and
and and I just believe that we can create
and and build upon the success of achieved in a way that we continue to grow
opportunity and in that way grow the strength of our nation so for example my economic policies
econ
so it's about things like investing in small businesses I love our small businesses the woman who helped raise us we call our second mother cuz my mother worked long days and hours
she was a small business owner so as a child I grew up
knowing that a small business owner someone who is a leader in the community hires locally trains locally
contributes to the Pacific and the cultural fabric right so my plan includes
extending a tax deduction for startup small businesses to $50,000 instead of what currently it is at $5,000 cuz nobody in 2024 can start up a small business with $5,000
my my I believe in you know I spend a lot of time talking particular with
with young families young people across our country and and frankly Steven the American dream right now is really elusive for far too many people terms of even aspiring to own a
we have a housing shortage so part of my plan is to work with the private sector with Builders and Developers
to build 3 million more homes by the end of my first term and to give first-time homebuyers at 25000
a down payment assistance so they can just get their foot in the door to home ownership which is the fastest and the most efficient way for people to build intergenerational
these are the ways that I think about how we build up our country in a way that is about supporting the middle class I come from the middle class I'm never going to forget where I come from
and I know that the middle class and strengthening the middle class is how you strengthen America and our economy
will your opponent your opponent and and his vice president and the other night in the debate said well comma Harris has been vice president for 3 and 1 years why isn't she fixed everything already
can you describe to them what the job of vice president is like and what have you told Tim walz about the
did you see that kid who was interviewed after their debate
what's the last big decision I made that was a gut decision
and when I was looking at potential running mates there are incredibly talented
exper
wonderful people
and ultimately I chose and asked him off because just my
tell me that
will be what I think we want in our country you know he reminds me of people I grew up with we grew up in two different parts of the country you know he grew up in a rural area in the midwest I grew up in California
look at the two of us together we have nothing in common
but
the kind of people I grew up with they may have been a different race in a different part of the country
hard-working folks
folks who are playing talking who
care about family care about community care about hard
risk your life on a daily basis no glamor no exploding watch starring Michael Fassbender Jeffrey Wright Jodie Turner Smith and Richard Gere CIA sends us out into the world to behave and dangerous ways people
I'm happy to say that the vice president Kamala Harris is still with us talk about what's going on in the world yesterday marked 1 year since Hamas attacked Israel and led to the
massive response by Israel in Gaz
many people at this point a year
are not only horrifying but what they're saying there but some people throw up their hands cuz they see no hope for any sort of peaceful resolution especially with the spreading to 7 Lebanon and and Hezbollah and the attacks by Iran on Israel now
do you do you know anything about what is possible in that area
reasonably that would give people reason
if there's no possible
so so yesterday we
commemorated
that Massacre that took place on October 7th last year and Doug and I actually
decided to have a very simple brief ceremony we planted a pomegranate tree
at the vice president's residence
in honor of those who
we're lost in the honor of also
frankly and I spoke about this what we must always retain which is some level of
what is possible in terms of shining light on a moment of darkness I truly do believe that's important
and it is something we learn regardless of your religion or
what we should all retain a sun level of op
and in this in this matter we we must have a ceasefire and hostage deal as is immediately as possible this war has got to end and has to end and and we cannot lose
belief in the possibility of it because then to your point we throw up our hands instead of rolling up our sleeves but it is complex and it is a conversation that requires probably more time than you and I have right now but briefly then yeah not briefly we've been told that
a ceasefire deal was very close several times what does that mean what does
close means
a lot of the details have been worked out
but details
so there has been some progress but it is meaningless unless the deal is is actually reached so I don't want to suggest to you that
that we should be applauded for getting clothes at times to a
the reality of it is 1200 people massacred there are still host is being held in
I've met with the families of hostages both who are alive and who have as we learned recently we have
I have met with families of palestin
who have been killed innocent people who have been killed in
and there is pain
that is happening in that region of the world and we must
work in the United States must work and not lose hope and not throw up our hands around the world we must play in in in in in in urging and seeking and building toward a resolution and the first thing that's going to unlock that is we've got to get a deal done and we're not going to give up well the the United States plays a role All Around the World in our foreign policy people look to us for leadership your opponent Donald Trump says that these and other this conflict Ukraine other things around the world he could fix it like that with a single phone call he loves talking about his clothes relationship with Viktor Orban and Kim Jong-un dictators and authoritarians and people who have been well described as murderers OK Google so I heard about it today I haven't read it on but
Donald Trump he he openly admires
and authoritarians he has said he he wants to be a dictator on day one if he were elected again
he gets played by these guys
he admires so-called strongman and he gets play
because they flattered
or offer him favor
is the Commander in Chief of the United States of America
Mustang
the principles that we hold dear we should stand with our allies we should strengthen the alliances that we have such as NATO which is the strongest military Alliance the world has ever
we must stand with our friend ukr
where Russia is attempting to change borders by 4:00 and then you hear if if if this is if everything I've heard about Bob Woodward's book is is is is is
Donald Trump
secretly Sent covid test kits to Putin for his personal
I asked everyone here and everyone who is watching
you remember what those days were
you remember how many people did not have tests
and we're trying to scramble to get them
you remember how rare that it was to have when you remember people by the hundreds were dying every day we would watch the number every day being reported of people who are
people who are in hospital
without their family
we're the only
that they had was of a nurse that they hadn't met because the family could not get there and this man is giving
covid test kits to Vladimir put
think about what this means on top of him sending love letters to Kim Jong
no think about it he thinks Vladimir Putin is his
what about the American people
vice president
go back my vice president tomyris you know for everyone when you first became the nominee and and named Tim walz as your vice president nominee people are calling it The Bible elections are all good but elections I think are one on Vibes because one of the old saws is I just want somebody they can have a beer with so would you like to have a beer with me so I can tell people what that's like OK Google OK Google
Eagles or Steelers
and no one will be mad
just choose one of those I'm sure it'll be fine
49ers preseason
and sadly you lost her to cancer 15 years ago what would you want your mom to know
about your camp
well I think she's watching everything actually
I miss her every day though I have to tell you my mother
she was
5 ft tall but if you ever met her you would have thought she was 10 ft tall she was quite a for
you know she taught us to fight for what we believe in
and
she was very much about you know if you see a problem
and that is part of what motivates me
to run for this office and to do the work that I do everyday but she's with me everyday
well
I want to ask you a question
speaker Johnson
recently called a got
and it's a question that a lot of Republicans are avoiding
did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election
you know I'm going to tell you what some of the people in in my rallies quite a few people are showing up by the way hey Bradley
you know
you've lost
you lost millions of jobs
you lost manufacturing you lost Automotive plants you lost the election what does that make you
a loser
of the electoral votes in the movie doing that on January 6th do you agree with Donald Trump that you could just named yourself the next president
when people are often applying for a job
bill as well why is the job open
one must ask why is the job of
what's Trump's running
why was it
and it was open because his vice president
Mike
stood for country above party stood for constitution above favor and pleasing someone who would and tried actively
including inciting of violent mob to under the will of the people undo the outcome of a free and fair election
and I do believe you know in this race I'm proud to have the support of a lot of Republicans who worked for both
presidents
for John McCain from Mitt Romney for Donald Trump
who are who are saying listen we got to put country above party we have to honor the Constitution of the United States and we want a president who will actually uphold the rule of law and and and and and and and and and and take seriously
to the Constitution of the United States and so when I think about this whole issue about
January 6th for a lot of folks who are supporting me and I think a lot of folks who voted for Donald Trump in the past that was a bridge too far
that was a bridge too
and that's what I think is going to motivate and has motivated a lot of people to say look it's time to turn the page
we need a new way forward enough with the nonsense we're exhausted
let's just let's let's push toward the future of our country let's not go backwards
she's running for president of the United States voting is in one month thank you for listening to The Late Show podcast show with Stephen Colbert just one more thing if you want to see more of me come to The Late Show YouTube channel for more Clips exclusives hey Google
