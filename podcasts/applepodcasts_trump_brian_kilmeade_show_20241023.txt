Fox News headquarters in New York City Solutions never sewing division
it's Brian Kilmeade
so glad you're here Rich Lowry at the bottom of the hour from the National Review Kayleigh mcenany is right here in our studio overseas we got our secretary of state going to Saudi Arabia we have
I guess
current president probably apologizing to Kamala Harris for his Antics yesterday in New Hampshire and before we get to Kaley let's get to the big three
what does stories you need to know three
handling of classified information
very very
we remain committed to supporting each other and being as transparent as we as possible and I'll leave it at that yeah we'll leave it at that never answers the question but he's more politician than General that is Secretary of Defense Austin leak satellite images on telegram while Pentagon says there are there are no suspects so far and the defense secretary Lloyd Austin didn't rule out the possibility
of an intentional leak by the administration this has Israel prepares to pay back Iran for their rocket attack a month ago
I guess would be good but you know people have different feelings about it but the main thing is you got to get out you got to vote and I'll be voting early
well Harris seems
Pull-A-Part on NBC as she struggles to Define and defend her programs and policies while taking the rest of the day off
he'll hear my full Trump interview today
Number One issues and swing States doing the Auto Workers in Michigan fracking in Pennsylvania and no tax on tips in Nevada I think it's been a clever campaign and all those respects and so I think
he's got the
the up 13 days and counting and Mark Penn a democratic pollster and it says this on Election Day looks pretty good right now for the president he's winning but he hasn't
VP Harris light schedule meanwhile Biden rages in hertz Harris again I don't even know if it's intentional or
losing it more than ever and I don't think the governor's on I don't even think he's got a staff with
Kelly mcenany co-host of outnumbered former White House Press Secretary and Kaylee you were with Trump when he lost so we had to finish out those final weeks famously people talk about January
but what changes when they know you're not coming back
yeah when I know you're not coming back you're a lame duck president and you have people who leave you have people who talk to reporters and we're seeing this with Joe B
you're no longer the administration and the wake of his comments about jailing Trump which he clarified him in politically
I'll leave yours or listeners to decide about that but there was a current Administration official who told a reporter and this is often a leak-free white house but told a reporter that no one listens to him anymore
that's what happens when you're a lame duck president and it's starting because you know Brian this has been a pretty good airtight Administration in terms of
right but you know he's so bitter obviously you saw that the funeral
for Ethel Kennedy he's obviously bitter that he's not there but really he's trying to put together again how he got ousted sees that she's no longer
you know surging plateaued and maybe dipping and thinking why am I not there again
you know she's not that good so he's having trouble processing
yeah how could you not be
this is a president who began his administration with I defeated Donald Trump I took him down
his face on Mount Rushmore one day
and now anyone will remember the Biden presidency solely and simply as the guy who stepped aside amid mental acuity issues that is his legacy and he's got to be thinking could it be different do we think that
I think people out there dinner table and at the tailgate say yeah mental acuity is
but no one
no one says it I was going to be one term I maybe I should be on the only reason you're one term is because you got out there by Nancy Palos
I personally think the story is going to be
weekday predicted everything except for that Harris would get the nomination
they wanted a jungle primary where Harris would be one of the people Clyburn even said in one of the Sunday shows she should be one of the people considered
okay if Clyburn was saying that
what will say the other big story that came out I believe is
Donnie Atlantic magazine story John Kelly speaking out and coming out and saying basically that Donald Trump
like
and often says he wanted
he wish he had Hitler's
at which time he described it say you know a lot of times his generals are trying to kill him
this Atlantic story also incl
someone whose daughter was killed on Fort
and there's controversy
can you frame it out
I'm about to go to bed I'm joining you on Fox and Friends and I see it
and the headline is about exactly as you described
the daughter was killed at Fort Hood
and it said that President Trump disrespected this family is the
and I look at the author and it's Jeffrey Goldberg and I think oh I know that name
that is the name of the individual who wrote the suckers and losers
which happened when I was press secretary and in hours we gathered more than a dozen individuals who said that is not true several who were eyewitnesses one of which Zach Fuentes need to John Kelly who you mentioned said he never said suckers and losers also other parts of the story were discredited with contemporaneous documents I brought to the podium so this is the individual who pedals Anonymous sources weeks before an election to try to affect the outcome in my view that's his goal
he talks about
but the family was showing so much love and respect by Trump the sister has come out and said Donald Trump has shown me nothing but love and respect I in fact voted for him today so once again here you have the Atlantic trying to sway an election weeks before CBS leading with the story
it is malpractice in my
she says my Ricky and sister of Vanessa
says I don't appreciate how you're exporting my sister's
for politics it's hurtful and disrespectful to the important changes she made for service members
president Trump did nothing but show respect for my family and Vanessa in fact I voted for president
good luck with that they love it on CNN MSNBC but at least take a step back
look at the guys track record
you see the way he cares about people whether it's a slain officer or it's a child you see the empathy that he has which they claimed he doesn't
but General John Kelly I guess when contacted as former Chief of Staff and never fond of the president
said this cut 28
authoritarian
Fred Meyers people who are dictators
definition of of fascist
General Kelly your
cuz you would kill you were there too yes don't know John Kelly he was before my time but what I do know is the Trump presidency
it was not fascist you could judge it for yourself in fact when you look at all the polling people are fond of the Trump presidency they remember better times there were no new Wars there was Middle East
did you see a fascist I certainly didn't I see another party that wants to pack the court
nonetheless targeting that group I see a lot of lawlessness on the other side but I did not see that
can I can I can everyone out there understand that every president
that you read about a stud
wrestle with the fact that they can't get things done exactly like they
do the Constitutional systems do the democracy that we have there are things that got to pass through things that are executive orders there's legislation that's got to be done sometimes you have to damage to democratic houses a House and Senate and you're a Republican president or vice versa
and there was frustration you always hear that the Democratic president talking to a dictator like the president of the president of China or the leader of Russia and they'll say you know I got to see if I can get this done I don't know if I can get it done I don't get that treaty ratified that doesn't mean he wants to be a dictator it
would Kelly just
he came from a world for 50 years
where was a family business by huge one but he just basically talked to his friends and family about executing his vision
obviously this is something that he needed some adjusting I don't think it means he wants to be mussol
yeah I saw a former cabinet Secretary of Donald Trump's last
he was giving a talk and I was listening to the talk and he said
something to the effect of private sector meant
is not rewarded in Federal
if anything people are hesitant to bring that to federal government because what happens is you end up having you know An Inspector General on you there's all kinds of Investigations because you're trying to do something different and it upsets the career politician
sets the career Bure
Donald Trump came in with a new and a fresh way of thinking it upset a lot of people upset the bureaucrats upset some of the general
but why did you get you got economic prosperity and you got peace around the world the private sector mentality
but to your point Brian there are a lot of people who don't get that and I guess you can't fault them because they've been doing this their whole life a certain way
but
Anderson Cooper needed to
so John Kelly provided it and here it is cut
so he went on to say no Hitler's generals kept trying to kill him so they have car private conversations
and Hitler did some good things that according to him he said
he brings that out now
why would you bring that out now 13 days before an election
when all the sudden the president former president is
yeah I never heard him say anything like that never ever ever ever in my hundreds of inter
I don't know why but I know president Trump's my point did things differently he called
Kim Jong-un Rocket Man on Twitter I'm sure the generals probably were a little apprehensive about that but look what it did you ever wanted to meet 101 with him he would pick up the phone argument Ukraine wouldn't have happened if there would have been a second term because Donald Trump maintain relationships with both
photos and friends and
and you didn't have Russia redrawing the map and invading a sovereign country I don't think he would have seen October 7th I think right now we'd be sitting here with a Saudi Arabia Middle East peace deal in a Ron totally Iced Out in the Middle East
but the way Donald Trump got there was upsetting to a lot of people
the Rocket Man the back and forth this is unconventional but maybe you need a little
Kelly in your estimation being
you've been in every side of it you've been a commentator you know you're an anchor you've been an Insider and then you also been working for campaign
and you also
can this move Needle on the on the few people that are un
absolutely not I don't think so look there are independent Nikki Haley
yes that can be
but I think what you are going to see based on the reporting that I've noticed is that Nikki Haley is going to come out
estimation and make a powerful argument on behalf of Donald Trump I think you'll see them on The Campaign together there is no one who could bat down an argument better than this then Nikki Haley who sat at the UN who observed Donald Trump day today and I believe no inside sourcing here but I believe she's going to do that and I think it's going to be very powerful would it be on MSG on
oh well first of all Brian I never questioned your political instincts cuz you predicted what happened this week last week and I think you just predicted what's going to happen next week
well that's the Rival of trump
will she be good but she wasn't she was created nicely
about at the RN
and you might say just to button it up the rest of the Republicans what do they say
8% or 10% are not voting for Trump Republicans less than that for Democrat
so would that be a good place to come out I asked him and you'll hear this next hour
are you doing this on the 27th as a New Yorker to culminate three campaigns and the end of campaigning for an office
I said I never thought about
for New York
I think around the country MSG is something specialist and iconic
call
it means a lot to a guy that sat in the front row and watch the Knicks and Rangers and Billy Joel for years it's very smart look when Trump makes a stop that doesn't make sense and that it's not in a swing
it does make sense nationally Aurora Colorado there is a specific immigration
a lot of Pop Culture Pizzazz to it MSG has a certain notoriety and I think you're going to see networks cover it and it gets social media attraction in a way that maybe one stop in Wisconsin would not I think in hindsight these are pretty brilliant I can't speak for Kamala going to Texas and Tim was going to
does it surprise you that in 3 hours they had the invitations it was MSG
not surprising in the slightest there's a lot of pent-up energy here for
New York metro area and not surprised that pin-up energy was channeled into a swamp
of Madison Square Garden you went for 3 hours with me
to 20 minutes with me but you in 2 and 1/2 hours are going to be doing outnumbered do you have any ideas
I talked to my producer in the middle of your show and now I get avocado
add the little fox Cafe can I go prep for outnumbered and I'll be ready to go Brian I'm always ahead of the game well that's true because carbs on the day
but you are smart you should get it scooped right or
learning something new everyday on the Brian Kilmeade show
lululemon.com
well you know it's interesting I really feel I'm very mixed you know I have the old standard
perhaps the Tuesday vote and a lot of people like to vote and I really miss you know the main thing to me is you got to vote you got to vote a voting early I guess would be good but you know people
a different feelings about it but the main thing is you got to get out you got to
and I'll be voting
in Florida
I guess you voted early in the primary too so
Donald Trump has to be pleased with some of the numbers of people voting early because if you look in the valley you look at Pennsylvania the numbers are way ahead where they were in 2020 and remember the theory is and it's a strong one it's going to be the same this time that is the Republicans win an election day and if Democrats are going to win it's going to be the voting early
not usually the military vote but it's going to be those who to do
Maryland voting and the ones who do early
Donald Trump
stopped everything when he said don't vote early I don't know what's going to happen to your ballot don't let them screw with your ballot vote on Election Day and that wasn't as good strategic move everyone knew it plus it was during the pandemic and a lot of older people said I'm not going to go stand online with big crowds I like to mail it
but then when you saw all the
just show up in people's mailboxes or an apartment buildings because yeah well that's a that looks like those ballots ready to be thrown away I'm not going to let that happen to my
can you listen to drive through balloting which is bizarre imagine a family of five the father pulls up tells everybody else
call who to vote for in the hand up the envelopes and their Dodge Dart and say there you go
well you'd have to ask him if that's the only reason why
I am running for president United States Joe Biden is
and my presidency will be about
a new generation of leadership To America that is focused on the work that we need to do to invest in the Ambitions and aspirations of the American people
what a ridiculous answer
why can't you ever be direct do you know this is an audition for the job that was interview
Haley Jackson Hallie Jackson
and Fastenal question that you and I have been asking all the time but nobody asked her why are you even the person why are you the vice president we hear about you making pancakes for your grand nieces and they want more bacon and he got a call from Joe Biden that he's not going to run he's a great and okay and so I guess I'll run know what happened behind the scenes was a Jerry Maguire like frantic push to round up dele
and block off would be contenders in order for you to get the nomination in this historic pull out thanks to the pressure from George Clooney Nancy Pelosi and most of all Barack Obama that's the story
and just saying I got a call from Joe saying he's out you have to ask
it's not going to suff
when does she realize she's got to be so much
you going to blame Bret Baier for asking too many questions
you going to blame NBC they're not nice enough to you
my goodness
Rich Lowry of National Review
Rich what's going on here I mean there's so many questions that even friendly Networks
are asking them and she can't answer
and she's stunned by
by the
yeah I think it's another case where she she can't answer
just because the the answer would be too devastating she should have to say she's being sincere and honest I know all along and and we're just going to try to lie our way through it and then we got caught you know that that's why I'm the nominee but of course she can't say that
so she has to dance around it and say you know I defer to Joe and who knows but the same thing on the border she is it's not as though she couldn't
not capable of giving a decent answer in the Border she doesn't want to give a decent answer because again it would be too devastating it would be look we blew it up deliberately it was a huge mistake we need we violated the law and and I promise not to do that the future that would be a reasonable answer but
you know she's not going to get any clear on any of the stuff the next 13 days
tell Mark Cuban came out and says because their hearts were too big letting refugees come into the country
I never saw the heard of more ridiculous answer in my
I just think they do have this this moral view it's twisted
but they think it's a moral of you that basically borders are retrograde you kind of your intolerant maybe a little racist if you want them for some so there's this whole category of people Asylum Seekers even if they're bogus Asylum Seekers that we don't have a right to ex
so it it does go to to to some sort of moral view or at least how they view their
but it's it's been a debacle and they didn't acknowledge it again it's like Biden being caught at the date they didn't acknowledge it until they are caught it finally done and I'm over running against Donald Trump his signature issues the border and we're going to get killed on this and then they try to do something but I've been kind of heart and it looks like she was catching up a little bit on the border but the polling shows that Trump continues to kill her on that so you know it's suddenly but a major issue is this transgender
were the taxpayers should be paying for prisoners to get sex changes
the answer obviously
to Americans
forget about party is of course
and should you be as a male who wants to be a female playing in women's sports the answer for a logical person is of course they should not be playing in men's
but she can't even answer it when confronted with this listen to this
Donald Trump's campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars they're trying to find you on this yes I'm asking you to Define yourself
that that is a decision that doctors will make in terms of what is medically necessary I'm not going to put myself in the position of a doctor
is she kidding I'm not going to put myself in the position as a doctor
yes she did she was perfectly comfortable to do it you know 3 or 4 years ago right so so what changed she did this on the border to with Brett I just want to ask about decriminalization and all this stuff just like I got to follow the law and they didn't follow the law on the border actually they violated the law quite explicitly in a massive way and on this too she was willing to make a value statement and normative statement a couple years ago and now she doesn't want to address it because she realizes it's a huge vulnerability and that had it's the best out of the cycle if Trump wins it'll be like one of the top five
reasons that that he wins and and Senate candidates all over the map Republican Senate candidates are using the same issue and you got Democrats running scared you got Democrats feeling obligated to to respond and lie about what they said in the past
so this is an issue that's hurting them and it's good the Republicans finally found their voice on this cuz a couple years ago they were all afraid to talk about it
and and now they're they're hitting Democrats on it deserve at least think about how much America's found their voice on this we all know that the borders broken we all know that mass deportation might actually be necessary
the country is for that the transgender surgery is playing a women's sports the country is now
who wants to stop that
you know
so many issues are just coming back home and then today I'm looking at the headlines how black lives matter wasted 90 million
why there isn't a major Scandal about this
I don't know but remember when you could not even say that all lives matter people lose their jobs now if you say black lives matter people think you're talking
he's out in New Hampshire for some reason feels he's got to talk about prescription drug prices
and how great he is so we can handful of people show up in a state that no one's talking about
and he says this cut
he is
who's the guy also wants to replace every single
every
Supreme Court ruling on
be able to feed
actually
illuminate
someone who
how many
so I know this sounds
5 years ago you lock
political documents walking out that's what we have to do
I have so much to say in this rich but you're my guest you get to go first politically lock them up what does that mean right the politically so this is the classic Freudian slip right it's what they wanted to do it didn't work
but they at least would have had him in the courtroom entirely from March to October maybe the last trial will be ending today for all we know and they put him in jail if they
so much happened I mean think about this this is two days after Nathan way to admitted he met with the Department of Justice and the white been in the White House three different times talking about this case
the Georgia
is the time in West Jack Smith with high by an attorney general who
the current president lamented that America on acted too slowly should have indicted president
and got him through Court a lot earlier
I mean he shows it remember in 2016 when Trump won he was in the Oval Office with Obama as they essentially found out they started planting the whole Russia investigation and covering their tracks he was sitting right there
so this whole thing was Freudian and the other ridiculous statement which I don't know what's worse if he believes it
or he doesn't believe
and set it the Supreme Court ruling on immunity allows him to shoot somebody
kill someone he believes he'll be able to get away to it or threaten to kill him and he'll be able to get away with it
there's nothing of this guy's a lawyer there's nothing about that ruling that says he can go shoot somebody
but he's telling another group of vulnerable people
that if you elect Donald Trump he's going to kill people and be immune for prosecution
Republican prosecutor will try to go after Biden or if comma Harris wins and is out in 4 years after Harris and then I'll get protected by this ruling and all of a sudden the ring will be great you know so it doesn't say Donald Trump is immune it says president and Donald Trump is not going to be our only president ever again you know so short-sighted and it just goes to the rank fear-mongering
on the other side I'm pretty strong and maybe you have so much more experience with this
but I'm just struck about the negativity coming out in the attacks through the surrogates on Trump Trump's always been tough and that's why he's always going to be Rosie O'Donnell or or
Kim Jong-un that's the way it is all you got to talk to you I'm not talking
listen to the man listen to the man representing the party of joy
cut 19
when
when he's not doing
strange
he's trying to sell you
I mean who
who is Hawk
when the running for
I mean he's trying to sell you golden
he's trying to sell
100,000
says it's made in Switzerland
so he's just going
I can't believe this guy is
yeah so this is kind of the the part of the Obama ammo is is mockery he did a lot of it and
and 12 but it's just that the joy campaign is over right they had the cliche was a sugar high I think that was right you know that the media was so on the tank and Democrats are so will need to be done with with Biden that they could do the joy thing
so I want you to hear Mark pancetta Democratic poster for Hillary and Bill Clinton I find him very interesting he doesn't care
who is being interviewed by he's going to hit you with the
and this is how he sees the race at this moment
I just
yeah here's mark
I think Donald Trump has an edge I would not count
Kamala Harris out at this point
Auto Workers in Michigan fracking in Pennsylvania
clever campaign
and all those respects and so I think
he's got the
so that's how he sees it is that how you see
yeah I totally agree it's what I thought all along that that he
issues that come inflation in the border and you know it's not a massive change but you can see it kind of tipping his way and in these in the swing States and and some national poll
as well so I kind of think he's going to win but look it's a margin of error race and every single
looking out there for for Harris or for Trump or one of them turns out more people than than we expect it could you know tip one way and it kind of a big electoral college
result but of course in 16 is closed until 1:00 I think it's going to be close again this year but I give you advantage
lastly what's your prediction on what Israel is going to do to
manufacturing these things they're so good they have been so subtle and effective the last five or six weeks I have no idea what they what they're going to do but I would not be sleeping very easily if I'm a terror operator
yes I just think that the whole region I think on some level is rooting for them to take out the nuclear program
except for President Biden and I can't get my head around that
I know we just want a World War but the best way to stop us to do that
stop someone from you know launching a nuclear weapon it stops you from doing things short of that so the whole environment would be different if it's totally intolerable
Ferran to get a weapon and it's just bizarre the last after the first two or three weeks after October 7th the the Administration has been bent on restraining Israel from doing the things that it that it needs to do and then and then when it works out they're like oh we're happy with that but stop now you know so it's it's bizarre sometimes you need to take your own side in a fight and these people are our enemies too write the word surrender not ceasefire Maryland election day and you know the results by you know like an hour or two after the polls close to Pennsylvania until election day it's complicated
we might not know till Saturday
Rich Lowry National Review it's exciting time rich thank you 186-408-7669

is that part of the transition process
welcome back to the Brian Kilmeade show on this Wednesday in the afternoon
did John Kelly story broke in the ATL
I had a chance to sit down or excuse me excuse
talk to the former president of the United States
the 45th president of the United States who wants to be the 47th president Donald Trump Mr President
how do you feel
13 days to go can you believe it first of all this time all these years all this
but I feel very good she's taking the day off and she's taking another day off I don't believe
I've gotten 52 days in a row
and another 13 days left and I'm just leaving to make a big
in North Carolina
and just I feel very good and you if you look at the early voting which you know as well as anybody it's looking very very strong I think
people are
for us at level
notary public has
Republicans tried to stay away from early voting you were unsure about especially in 2020 Florida started voting are you going to vote early kind of set example or do you want to send example on voting day
yeah I'm very mixed on it I mean I'm okay with the Tuesday voting which they like doing Republicans like and I'm also I say the main thing I say is vote but ideally I guess a lot of people would like to see early voting you know where you stand a little bit and I'm okay either way Brian really I really am when you talk about something you're doing word is out that you're going to sit down with the number one podcast from the Country Joe Rogan you met him a couple of times
why is this the right time to do the interview it's going to go about 3 hours
that's a huge commitment
where the guy with everything everything's in play well I don't know I think they talked about doing it and I don't know we talked about it for a long time
I think he's a nice guy I've
couple of times at
and I don't know it's not just seems something to do it said no real strategy there Brian I do it and I do a lot of
I do a lot of shows good bad or indifferent I do a lot of shows
they come out good with leading we we won the Republican
nomination in a record time in the fastest anyone's ever won it and we were doing very well now we're up in the polls against this woman
you know and I say it loudly she's a low IQ person we've had a low IQ person for the last 4 years we cannot afford to have it any longer
and it's sort of it is an amazing that when you have 13 days left that somebody takes off and you're talking about the
that's not what we
sit down
but I think it might be very interesting
I think he's fantastic I don't even go wrong and the one thing we have in common I did the first UFC's with Jim Brown when no one knew what it was and Joe Rogan and named help make it along with Dana White one of the most successful franchises in the world
I want you to hear you talk about illegal immigration and migrants overrunning cities like we have 66,000 here right now President Obama brought that up he's the surrogate who is doing work
well the vice president does perhaps other things are interviews I want you to hear what he said
and the reason some people
I don't know I remember that economy when he first came in being pretty good
yeah it was pretty good cuz it was my economy
so we'll talk about the the illegal immigrants what he said but for there on the economy is that why your economy did good because you inherited Obama
no I had a whole different thing a whole different philosophy my economy did good cuz I got the tax cuts I got the greatest tax cuts in the history of our country
we had the best job numbers of
have anybody we had the best I had the best economy in history and in the history of our country yeah I think I get credit for it I do I get credit for that I get credit for the military I get credit for not having gotten into a war you know a lot of people thought I'd be in a war in 24 hours
we had peace through strength I did take over a mess that they left me with ISIS
defeated them in Rapid in Rapid time you know we really did I rebuilt the military characterizing your success Mr President do you think that he is but he doesn't he doesn't characterize anything that
proper I mean what he what he does he'll say anything anything that comes to mind as long as
positive for him I mean what he did what he did to Biden was pretty incredible I watched the way he let him off the stage and I will say what he did to bid
I think it was really terrible
they sabotaged by whether you like Biden or not he won the nomination and then they took it away from
and it's never been a
he certainly sounded up being more with Donald Trump who's going to be running through the tape with a very very busy schedule
which looks to be much busier than the vice presidents more with Donald Trump in just a mom
newsmakers and newsbreakers period
I had a full 30 minutes unedited uninterrupted with President Donald J Trump after the break as I told you we're going to have more guess what it's after the break and use more so I want to talk about what's happening for our policy right now Rush is hosting this brick
it includes China India Brazil South Africa Russia obviously UAE Ethiopia or
together they represent
20% of the world economy 43% of the world's population is that a threat to the G7 and are you calling on our allies like India and UAE to drop out of it and turkey to stay
I'm not calling on anything I think it's a threat it's always a
but the reason that threat is there is because
Biden and Kamala are so pathetic as leaders are
administration of the history of our country Jimmy Carter looks brilliant by comp
I mean they are the worst there's never been anything
like this administr
they are incompetent they don't know what they're doing and will end up in World War III over these people so I mean I don't
ditto
blaming
because frankly if we had a real president that we had a president that know what he was doing and the vice president that
and she's worse than
she's worse than him I really believe that I think she'll be actually worse than him but you do look at bricks as a threat and that's something you want to address cuz they want to get off the dollar the dollar is
is what Russia wants to do
will you please stop that as soon as I get in and I will solve it very strong and very nicely
it
there's no way we get off the dollar if we get off the dollar that's like losing a world war that would make us a third world
be losing the dollar losing that the status of the dollar would be a a loss almost of a World War
and it's not going to happen if I'm president it's not now
it'll be nice if they can start today instead of January
but you're right that is a
to the dollar and it's a threat militarily that's a big Force you're talking about before and there's no reason for this this should have never
before I even premises I know you believe in that there's indications you're
that Ukraine would never been invaded if you had won the second
however there is a war going on and you will inherit it if you
and right now it's been confirmed
fighting for Russia on North Korean soldiers and Chinese Merc
South Korea's indicated if North Korea is going to fight will
what do you do about this and is one of the things releasing the restrictions on the weapons that we give zelinsky to actually hit the people before who are hitting you because right now they're restricted your thoughts well you know you mentioned the beginning just the beginning of this question that you know
I know it wouldn't have happened it would not have happened and that's the sad part so many people are dead so many people are killed so many cities
almost most of them are just laying on their sides broken up into Smithereens what a
far more people died Brian as you know you but you see that far more people died and it's a it's a horrible
and I hate what happened but that is going to be your problem is the president is it's going to be on the Resolute desk
top priority what would you do about that it will be a top priority and I'll get both sides together and I'll try and knock something
and I think I'll be successful
it was a lot easier before it started that I can tell you and think of all the lives that
we're
it really was is Vladimir elected War Vladimir Putin's elected War
and he basically lost his Navy
to a bunch of drones that zelens
I think they've been brilliant in many ways but now they got their hands full they got two other countries fighting against them
you didn't see that coming Brian you got other countries going
and you have an incompetent president and you have any confident vice president she's more incompetent
I want you to hear what's happening
at least so I can Democrat
Senator Casey Democrat are using you
in their ads in a positive way listen
well you got two others because you have an Ohio that's happening and there's a couple of others too I guess it's a compliment but
I just hope it doesn't affect
I would imagine it's probably a compliment another rule saying
at least tariffs are finally becoming popular I'm not sure how you feel about it but I will tell you
tariffs are going to make us rich again is that tariffs on the way to go to my favorite word in the dictionary outside of love and religion right let's move to Israel Israel is has done the impossible they've decapitated
Hezbollah they've released and located their financing
wiped out all but one battalion of Hamas including their leadership and now they've all been promised and it's expected they're going to hit
I know you talked to prime minister Bibi Netanyahu over the weekend
without giving away intelligence I know you're concerned about the leaking or the hacking whatever it is
what would you say to them about
what site should be hit or not hit inside
I should have ironic the way you put that question because you say without giving away
Bryant Park intelligence or their intelligence has been totally leaked that was a massive
and somebody is a real enemy to have done that they've leaked the entire you know 70 whatever it is different plans and versions of it
to the
to the world think of it how would you like to be Israel to wake up and find out that all of your various plans are attacking Iran have been
to the media enter the world
and this can only happen to this Administration
this group of people are just so bad and they think it comes out of the Department of Defense but who knows right I think it's a sandwich in this Administration for Iran
and does things change when you come in if you win
we're going to get everything straightened out we're going to get Russia and Ukraine settled up we're going to get them settled up we're going to work like hell and I know you'd like to see that
and I know how you feel about it and I fully understand how you feel about it we're going to try and get that settled up and stuff we got to stop the killing the deaths all that
horrible wasted death it's so sad to
you know that whole culture has been taken down because those cities are knocked down to the ground for the most
outside of a few areas it's I mean
you look at those cities every single building
some of the Magnificent does magnificent golden towers and everything they're all gone
smithe
and far more people than anybody knows right you're going to find that out but but I am going to sit down with them and I know both of them very well
and I'm going to try and get that thing done I'm going to try and force
between
with Israel that's actually in a certain way
you might say it's more complicated but maybe not as difficult if you want to know the truth it's probably a more complicated situation but maybe not as difficult but if Iran is the problem you know Brian I think you would be believing it is October 7th would have never happened to Ryan was
they didn't have money for Hezbollah they didn't have money for
they had no money that they were absolutely they would have made a deal and I would I would have made a deal that's good I want to make a deal that's good for everybody
but we don't want our end to have a nuclear weapon but if you look at your message Sierra Community if you look at the Abraham Accords there's really no Administration has done more maybe Jimmy Carter when he brought Egypt to the table with Menachem bagin and watch the
to bring the Arab world together with Israel then you
so is that the message to Michigan
but I'll tell you the message to Michigan really is that if they would have gone with the Accords so we have the four countries
we're going to get a lot of countries we're going to get those countries back in there the the Abraham Accords was one of the greatest things
maybe one of the greatest things maybe the greatest that the Middle East has seen it can easily be filled out
and I think it would have been filled out and I even think they were there would have been a chance at that time because
Iran was not in a great negotiating position and although I must say over the last 4 weeks and not in as good a negotiating
position as they would have been a long time before it's amazing what happened now had Israel listen to
they would be waiting for a bomb to be dropped on the head right now there's a theory of
there's a theory that the Prime Minister after meeting with Joe Biden and Kamala
said that if if Trump is not to win
things are going to change dramatically so I have to win now do you believe he changed his strategy after he came to the US and met with them and she did not show up for the joint session of Congress
I don't know but he's been pretty much on his own
he has not been listening to Biden Biden wanted them to stop immediately
and if he did you you literally would be waiting for that bomb to drop down on Israel that's probably what would have
and he's in a very strong position right now
but with all of that being said we'll see what we can do in terms of getting peace but
he is really put himself a babies
hell of a job for fighting but he would not listen to Biden he wouldn't do it he wouldn't listen to find don't forget when they made the original you know when the United States made the deal
the day he came here he was begging Obama and that time Obama and Biden but basically OB
not to make the deal a deal that I broke and a deal that it was a great thing that I
do you know if I didn't break the deal that the deal would be coming through right now they'd be able to evaporates yeah it ends it would end in 10 years was very shortly and they would have a clear path to do it there was in theory nothing you could do about it
there was a lousy deal whoever made that deal
but that was a very bad deal for the United States it was a really bad deal for is
and I terminated
we're working all these things on you know when they're in flux because it's like what are you going to do
what am I going to do today is going to be what am I going to do tomorrow is going to be different you know because it's changing rapidly changing right now you're running and Ukraine I'd love to end the
war between Russia and Ukraine I really think that we got to get that one
I'd love to see that
I thought it was it's been badly handled by everybody including Biden I mean the Biden when he what he was saying
at the time there's no reason Russia would have gone in we would they would have never gone in and I hate to say that you know it's been a disaster for Russia too they've lost 100,000 people they've been isolated economically and falling apart but just to bring it back bring it back locally or actually to Israel real quick they're going to hit targets and it's going to be in a matter of weeks the third missile system is there they got the arrow David sling and they have the Iron Dome now that it's in place
150 to 150 Rockets their way and it's all but embracing for it
what time would you like to see them hit the oil fields the nuclear Fields the military bases in a very bad position in terms of negotiating
but a lot of people would say let me put it that way that you hit the nuclear and you hit the oil
but I don't want to be the one to say that because I don't want to get involved and I do speak to BB and I speak to a lot of people
and you know I from a negotiating example if I'm going to be involved but what people are saying now Biden is saying the exact opposite don't hit the oil and don't hit the nuclear
he's taking the opposite of breakfast everything you know in history Brian if over the last 40 years you went the exact opposite of
every single decision the exact even
even if you look at
look at the World Trade
we want 30 minutes took a couple of breaks here's more of my interview
kind of exclusive with the 45th president who really believes he's about to be the 47th I want to talk about something in New York that you can relate to and that's Danny Penny this hero Marine in my view
sees a problem on a subway car
and used his training to to seduce Jordan neilly
maybe due to some drugs in the system we don't know he loses his life now he's on trial at stake his freedom maybe 15 years in prison
your take on what he's going through and what would you like to see
well I guess you have to look at the also the record of the
other gentlemen we're talking about like 30 or 35 arrests or something like that it was
are you going to have to hear from the people in the subway cuz they were very very scared
they were from what I understand very scared
and I'd have to look at it in a little more detail but it sounded to me
he was very aggressive in the subway and they were afraid for their lives and I assume they have some of those people testifying so we'd have to take a look at that
but
age of it's at awfully tough case I think it's an example of crime in the subway I mean there's always been crime in the subway in New York especially in the 70s and
but it is dangerous now and has Good Samaritan standing up
and and now he's on trial when almost nobody else in New York aside from you
the other thing that comes to mind is you're going to be at Madison Square
now October 27th is going to be Sunday already we're reservations you were sold
is this because the you look at as the perfect way to culminate three campaign
well I didn't think of it that way we're really looking to win New York if we
do we think there's a chance of winning New York first time since a long time many many deck
and we think there's a real chance with what's going on with the migrants taking over the city
taking over the whole state frankly if you look around they're all over
and a lot of crime crimes in an all-time high
you would think we would do very well in New York and it starts for New York but it is it's also you know it's MSG it's Madison Square Garden
you like guys like you and I that means a lot of those words Madison Square Garden right don't you think so and Sid Rosenberg coming up who's going to speak first that's going to be great
yeah we're going to have we're going to have a good time I think we're going to have a great time
it is in a certain way I didn't do it for that reason I did it because
it's a very big
and you know we sold it out in 3 hours it was totally sold out in 3 hours which is pretty amazing when you think of it for politics I don't have a guitar and you can do it
when you can do that in 3 hours without a guitar that's pretty good
but there's a great feeling you know we did great in 2016 we actually did much better in 2020 as you know in terms of
this one will be there's no comparison between the first two and this one the level of enthusiasm I think you see it too the level of enthusiasm for this is
greater than anything I've ever done
take a look at McDonald's I went into a McDonald's it's B
incredible
Google says it's one of the most searched things I've ever had it's it's pretty wild so it's all about the level of enthusiasm and we've never had anything like this
Doug amhof I'm sure you didn't have a chance to see this or maybe you did they're running out so many ads he's got an ad out with Ben Stiller and Andy Cohen talking about the need to be a girl dad and stand up for abortion rights with the scandals rumors swirling around him should he be telling us how to be a girl dad
no I don't think so I think it's that good
I think that
I think the whole group is not so good this is not what our country needs I hope that we're going to have
the kind of results that we're seeing
in early voting you know the early voting has been
extraordinary so far I would say beyond our wildest expect
if you look at the North Carolina you look at George I guess somebody one of
I think the Atlanta paper came out with about
405 point spread already that we're leaving
and we're doing we seem to be doing very well in early voting but who knows we have to get it you have to get it over the top this great enthusiasm we've never had to
it's my third time doing this and we've never we did an incredible in 16 we did better in terms of voting by millions of
the second we've never had enthusiasm right now and part of the reason is because they've been so bad
you like to break down the numbers out of the seven Battleground States what worries you the most
which one the which
all of them I mean the biggest
risk to me I think we win it easily I think I would have
at at 30% of what I've done you know I haven't taken a day off in 52 days
and now I have 13 and she's sleeping today and she'll sleep by here tomorrow too she's going to sleep all day she like Biden she likes to sleep a lot well I haven't taken I haven't taken days I have not taken
days off at all nor
you know this is the big thing this is going to be make America great again we can't take a
our country if we don't win this race our country is in serious Je
what are one sports question but before I do that this quote from Barack Obama
he wants you to believe meaning to Trump if you elect him he will round up whoever he wants ship them out and all our problems are going to be gone when I hear Donald Trump talk he's very quick to say comma you're the vice president you had it for 4 years
he said dude you were the president for 4 years why haven't you done it would you responds to Obama well I did do it we had the strongest Border in history I built hundreds of miles of wall I did do it if you look at that famous chart that now very famous chart the lowest point that we've had for virtually what kind of attack plan is that then do you think
like you know do you notice when he's attacking you
I don't care what he says look I mean the guy I thought he was a very divisive president not a good president
and look at look at the kind of things look at the mistakes they made when he was president
frankly compared to
he was good compared to this group he was good but he was a very divisive president not a good president at all but when they say why didn't Trump do it I did do it I built hundreds of miles of wall I was going to build 200 more they were all set to be put in
and these people didn't do it
and we had the best
Border in history
and for him to say that is just pretty amazing but that's all right let him say nobody here's the good news about Obama nobody listens
when when the vice president is campaigning she's doing town halls with Liz Cheney she's trying to get disinfected I guess disenfranchised Republic
why do you think she's doing these town halls with Liz Cheney Liz Cheney had the biggest loss in the history of the United States Congress losing
almost 40 points
the biggest loss because most people when they're down that much if they're in Congress what they do is they resign before going through a humiliation like that
she is so bad she was a war
like her father a Warhawk he was the
push Bush into the Middle East
spent 10 trillion dollars I've been thinking of a 10 trillion dollars that we
we got nothing
everybody got death out of it loss and
and listening it's very interesting because
here you have somebody that went into the middle
and she's trying to get this is the man who wanted to get strongly wanted to get
into the Middle East and kill the r
and she's trying to get
Arab supporters
that's why I never got along with her she wanted to go to war with everybody
you know big Brave Liz Cheney let's kill a lot of people so disgraceful we know that I think it's a huge negative for her by the way
Kamala as the expression goes why is why do you think she's not campaigning at all with President Biden and what do you think that what messages
well I think she's not campaigning at all she's off today
and she's off tomorrow or the next day and I've gone 52 days in a row
and we have 13 left and I won't be taking off I will not be taken
but think of it she's off today and she's going to be off tomorrow David this is not what we want for a president
so what I used to cover Sports they used to say yeah Donald Trump's up there with George Steinbrenner as usual
do you guys used to go in the Yankee Heyday good and bad days you sit there and watch George Steinbrenner erupt or cheer very consequential guy now your mutual friend Landing Levine is Randy Levine is running things I try to get some inside information about the World Series first one in New York since 2009 first time they met since 1981
Donald Trump your prediction on the World Series seen on Fox
game 1 game 2 will be out in Los Angeles your thoughts about how long it goes and who's going to win
well I'm going to say the Yankees you know Randy is a great friend of mine George and the family
is families made of a lot of terrific people
and so I have to go with the Yankees of course but
we'll see what happens at Dodgers have a great team you know they have a great team
but the Yankees are hot with
I would say they have maybe a little bit of
what are the odds on it by the way who's who's favored to win similar that's a great that's a great question I'm not a big betting guy I would think the Dodgers might be favorite with the better record overall
but the Yankees really close to the playoffs and and judges beginning to hit Dodgers are favor
-130 people are we you know that to you know we don't want to but I'll say the Yankees will win you and I will talk about it will you go to a game I'd like to go you know the problem is because of the Secret Service stuff I don't want to make it uncomfortable for everyone else is the president's really appreciate the time over in Nebraska right now
whether it's going to be that important or not it may be under a you know certain Limited
under a limited circumstances it could be a very important vote but I do great in Nebraska I'd love to get that Omaha vote you know it's a little bit segmented from the
I understand a little bit of a rope Senator out there decided that he wanted to get a little free publicity so he didn't get that done but that's okay I would love to get that I would love to get that vote and to the people of Omaha please be nice to me thank you yes and you could vote early and said an example if you wanted to in Florida that would be an interesting decision
well you know it's interesting I really feel I'm very mixed you know I have the old standard
perhaps the Tuesday vote and a lot of people like to vote and I really miss you know the main thing to me is you got to vote you got to vote a voting early I guess would be good but you know people
a different feelings about it but the main thing is you got to get out you got to
and I'll be voting
that's interesting great and we'll see if Elon Musk is doing that too he's making sure everyone votes right now on his campaign is busier than her too believe me Ford Benjamin Franklin whatever he's unbelievable
think of it he got it from North Carolina starlink when they had no Communications people were dying over no communication
and he got it to them right away at my request
he's amazing that guy so nice to have him on my side Brian do you agree he's got a good cars and good space
and he doesn't waste anything they land intact
nice to the president to sit down and give me some quality time yesterday in the afternoon and I have to say I have a chance to talk to him as I said before as dating back to 8
when I was doing sports phone graduating college
and you know when he's upbeat who's upbeat pretty much every minute until he became a politician
but sometimes you have signed and he's hopped on with us here in the show live
and hi
kind of angry
yesterday
when I when I call when he called in and we patched me in and he said hello
we having a small talk and I was trying to say this is not on because I know I just want to see what you think and how you think it's going
he really feels good about his
he feels like things are going but then a few hours later
the outcome the story in the Atlantic about what general Kelly says he said about
German Generals in Hitler and
gold star
here we
and I predict
there'll be some type of pushback from these generals that work for
Animal Crossing Admiral mcraven didn't like
General kelly didn't like
and we also have
General Madison
Robert O'Brien was fantastic National Security advisor McMaster likes a lot of what he didn't didn't but he did a great job
and then John Bolton took over his later
John Bol
was a bad mix for the
I like John Bolton he's been a great friend of the show but for him to think that Kamala Harris would be better for the country
Donald Trump
come on Harris is a
she stands for nothing she's done
accomplish nothing where's vice president ever
the most maligned certainly since Dan Quayle all the damn quell their indications
it was
so I thought he was
and I thought he was pretty strong yesterday
we'll see where we're going and we did find out that he's voting early and I know it's not the sexiest Topic in the world you might not be talking about your tailgate this weekend
but the whole Brick story is 32 nations form
to essentially be aunt
auntie
to try to find an economic force that would freeze us
and we have some allies on that and I asked him about that and you hurt his answer on
if it ends up being
the D dollarization of the world is like a third world war we have to restructure all our debt and everything else
what's coming up Friday is Joe
so Rogan who said I'm not going to interview Trump because I don't want to help him
has changed his
had a chance to meet him talk to Dana White who's one of his best friends
and one of Joe Rogan's best friends they have mutual and getting to see how everything is falling out and Elon must be your best friends with Rogan he's not saying I'm endorsing any
but what he saying is come to the shelf for 3 hours
and you will
just like Andrew Schulz it's outstanding comedian who has a podcast
you'll see the numbers even for Joe Rogan go through the roof cuz you're going to want to see them interact you have no idea what Rogan's going to bring
but the reason why Trump thrives
is the only thing they'll bring up is personal things that might be
Trump doesn't care about personal stuff you want to talk about the color or this or that you got to bring up 1970s and some type of
situation with his daddy's not going to embrace it
you'll talk about everything
so that won't be a problem and I think you'll see that side of
and baby Joe Rogan without any notes will bring up something nobody else
I brought up yet that he's not going to read a book
maybe watch the news
but overall you're looking at
Donald Trump
is on
of winning if the election was today I think he
pictures of the momentum and judging by the actions of the other
in
for comma Harris to take off entirely yesterday
she doesn't need any more fundraisers got more money than anybody else ever used you cannot spend all this money
everybody knows you got more
but then to go to Texas
tomorrow
really why you going to Texas
I want to help out calling all right
Ted Cruz
why do you care about
in which more than likely the Democrats going to lose in the state that you're not going to win
do you worry about your seven
I'm so busy hurricane victims in North Carolina that's an idea go to Michigan and don't just stay in Detroit that's another idea
make sure you call +1-866-408-7669 Martha MacCallum will be here at the bottom of the hour and Mike Dunleavy the 12th governor of Alaska
he's been doing this since 2018 will be joining me shortly and we have a lot to do special thanks to the former president for joining me at a previous hour depending on when you're getting the show and keep the money go to Brian Kilmeade show.com and you can hear the entire interview on Eid
so before we get to the governor of Alaska let's get to the big three
you know that I take handling of class
very very
are we remain committed to supporting each other
being as transpar
Corvette no one would ever have found
leak satellite images on telegram while Pentagon says they are they have no suspects and defense secretary Lloyd Austin didn't rule out the possibility of
intentionally by someone in his administration
this is Israel prepares to pay back Iran for their rocket attacks from a month ago
I guess would be good but you know people have different feelings about it but the main thing is you got to get out you got to vote and I'll be voting early
all right that's pretty big news he told us he's voting early lot of difference in 4 years ago and he said only
on Election Day there you go I talked to president Trump for 30 minutes while President while vice president Harris seems to fall apart on NBC she struggles to Define and defend her programs Pollock
and her loyalty and health of president
you'll hear the hole for a trump interview and listen to it and we'll get some clips for it
I think
he's got the
that Smart Pain Democratic strategist poster 13 days until election day for 2024 early return show with surge in Republicans getting out to vote early under Trump when he usually is he's a day a game guy damn quietly start to panic about the polls in my View BP Harris had a light schedule which is an odd way to say I'm trailing meanwhile buying rages
Paris in the Pro
Governor Mike Dunleavy joins us now Governor great to hear from you
it's great to be on Brian thanks for having me now that you're in the mainland are you with us or in
no I'm in Alaska 708 a.m.
wow I appreciate you getting up early so Governor where do you feel this
I think reality setting in I was just listening to your last your top three and your segments I think reality setting in that
Harris's you know there's there's nothing there and that people are looking back for years and asking themselves are they better off today
then they were four years ago and anyone that's honest is going to say no if you're a college student you you're living with your parents you can't afford to pay off your loans you can't afford to buy a
I mean the list goes on and on and on and look at the wars in the Middle East the Hootie swinging rockets at Israel what's happening in Russia
none of this is happening under Trump and I think people are starting to realize that that actually those four years were pretty good years they shut down the Red Sea Crossing people go around Africa now so this is absolutely incredible
Columbus had it
Kamala Harris shut down with NBC thought you'd have a walk in the park
the problem is she can't have walk in the park and she never wants to answer a legitimate question listen to this cut
Donald Trump's campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars they're trying to find you on that yes I'm asking you to find yourself
that that is a decision that doctors will make in terms of what is medically necessary I'm not going to put myself in the position of a doctor is she kid
you don't have any opinions on transgender surgery
she does Brian but she doesn't want to stay with they are that's the problem and that's what people are saying you don't have that problem with President Trump
are you running on it
I want to talk about energy you matter so much to you when people come out Governor done leaving and say well energy production is up I don't know what you're talking about being a new green deal Administration what could you tell us is the reality is you seen
Alaska to be honest with you has been brutalized by this Administration the center of Dan Sullivan has a very interesting chart that shows 66 actions by this Administration in the past four years against Alaska just Alaska only
everything from shutting down Anwar which was open up in 2017 and the Bill signed by Congress
the offshore oil leases npra National Petroleum Reserve which is a petroleum reserve it was there for oil 13 million Acres taken off the table the list goes on and on and on and Alaska is a resource State we were producing 2 million barrels per day in 1989 were still producing about $500,000 barrels today
a tremendous opportunity to drive down the cost of energy in the United States of America and help our Asian allies but
every turn every day there seems to be a new executive order
savoring you know talking to Venezuela to get oil or Saudi Arabia as opposed to its own country and
we're really looking forward to this election up here in Alaska that I could tell you is the only Red State left in the West Coast
president Trump is going to win up here in Alaska and we'll do our part to get to get him over the finish line so let me get this straight you doing 500,000 you could be doing 2 million
we were doing 2 million we're doing 500,000 barrels now but if they allowed
just to take advantage of the opportunities that we have
we estimate will be back up to 8 0 0. 0
and Anwar was part of the tax reform pack
so we can't get ahold of
the
Biden excuse the Biden
energy plan now the Harris energy of energy plan we know where she stood in 2020 but listen dating back to 2019 I want you to hear her all her different positions
when it comes to oil and gas cut
there's no question I'm in
do you still want to
no and I made that clear on the
would
I made that very clear
I have not banned fracking
tie breaking vote on the inflation
which opened
so where do we believe then we have
are surrogates coming out yesterday saying they say you can keep fracking but no new exploration that is his Club this Camilla Thorne
and then she walked it back saying I didn't explain myself clearly
contrary to Trump's claims the VP has
not ban fracking and doesn't support Banning fracking
she cast the tie-breaking vote on the inflation reduction act about fracking about new leas
open to new leases after saying they weren't and currently were in a
this is a big deal
cheerleaders you know Brian I'm originally from Scranton Pennsylvania and the other guy that's from Scranton Pennsylvania county which is just North of Scranton is refracting is really taking place I've Got Friends
and they don't believe
they don't believe what you saying they believe what you were saying years ago in which you wanted to band tracking but they don't believe the new Kamala Harris today and so
again I'm optimistic that Pennsylvania is going to do its part as well and making sure that we can put the last 4 years behind is it and really look at a future for for last excuse me for all Americans and
nobody but nobody believes that that's why you see her her poll
and her possibilities is one of the selection
right and I guess we're going to see what happens with the Republican party also with the Senate you get a good indication of where the elections going
because you look at the Senate it looks like McCormick is closing
how deep is closing in Wisconsin McCormick is closing in in Pennsylvania and you have Bernie Moreno who's coming out of nowhere he's now within one point of Charlotte Brown
who's a long-term Senator there in Ohio do you look at them she is up five it looks like
in Montana looks like that'll
does that indicate to you that something's happened at the presidential level
yeah I think so I I think you're going to see I think you're going to see a number of a senate races turn in for the Republicans I think we're going to get just get one we're going to get several to have a cushion in the
I'm also optimistic on the house I know that some people are questioning that but I'm optimistic on the house up here we have one seat that used to belong to Don young for 49 years
and we're optimistic that we can get back that back to a republican seat and
right now we're holding our breath up here we're doing our part but I think you're going to see I think you're going to see Republicans in charge because it again you just have to look at the last four years Brian are you better off the last 4 years and you were before with President Trump and the answer is clearly know whether
where do your internationalist looking at what's happening across the globe whether you're interested in energy or whether you're just a senior going to the store to try and buy food
it's worth today that it was 4 years ago so Mitch Landrieu is key spokesperson for the campaign
former Governor he is still optimistic about Harris's chances listen to how he describes her schedule Cuts in the vice president and the entire team of us have been traveling to every swing state I mean at nauseam I mean if you go look at the schedule of the vice president was in three states yesterday not just one and then weeks before that have been aggressively gone to all of
the swing States the point is that there is a there is an issue that is bigger than whatever might a difference is we may have about some policy agreements and that is the protection of democracy and I think that when you can say that you've got Bernie Sanders and Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney and 25 of the people that worked with Donald Trump all saying that hey he shouldn't be anywhere near the Oval Office I think when you highlight that I think it makes a big difference what's your reaction
you know I've heard this for years and it to me it's just nonsense the president Trump there was no food there was no National Guard called an army called in and it's it's it's it's it's it's your monitoring it it's worth and it's a it's a rejection of reality in history it's just never happened and it won't
that's the only thing they hope they cannot
is is that that that that fictional the long long story
people see right
people again when they go to the store when they fill up their gas tank when they try and buy a house when they're trying to pay off their student
they're thinking about those bread-and-butter issues and those are the real issues that almost all Americans are thinking about so what about Russia and the constant breaches of your borders in our air and International Air space
are you seeing that I'm watching North Korea
is now sending troops into Ukraine to fight with Russia China doing military exercises to blockade Taiwan we hear about Russia breaching our airspace what are you seeing up in Alaska Governor done leaving yeah let me give you some perspective miles from Russia
two and a half miles 50 miles from the mainland 2 1/2 Mi between two islands 101 by United States and 10 by Russia very very
we have flyovers constantly and it's
which if you look at the Middle East and what's happening around the world
it's not difficult for some to perceive
they're going to test our defenses we have the Chinese that claimed that they're near Arctic Nation
the one is not even working and so
they look at this and they say to themselves maybe this is an opportunity to flex our
we also have the Koreans one of the Korean North Korea missile and brother we have we have interceptors here in Alaska
don't get me wrong we have a very strong military up here
we're used to being and playing in this dangerous backyard as the main sport for North America
when you have a when you have an Administration in Washington that exudes weakness across the globe you're going to have these outfits trying probe our defenses but
again I think if they had an opportunity to vote they probably vote for vice president Harris yes because they know that once president Trump gets in it's going to be a different ballgame right of she's from a middle class family that could be intimidating and according to Putin she has an infectious
so he's having a great time with this matchup Governor Mike Dunleavy thanks so much
hey thanks for having me
honest commentary unique opinions No Agenda
fracking in Pennsylvania
campaign
he's got the
that is Mark Penn Democratic strategist I just want to play that for Martha MacCallum to get us off talking about this elections one point of view Martha everyone's got one was subjected to the pollsters
let us know what's going on in people that tell us what's happening when we're not out in the trailer sales Martha your reaction to a mark pen just say great to see it you know it's great to be with you as always now we are inside of two weeks out it's super exciting time to be covering all of this
every morning I seem to wake up to something that has popped into my inbox that explains how the polls are different this time they're doing more text messaging they're doing different kinds of Outreach their panicked because they don't know if they're right or wrong and they could have gotten it wrong again this time so we'll see what happens on Election night but I always like listening to MARC Penn I think he's a very straight shooter he worked for Hillary Clinton's campaign is a long time democratic
operative and yet I think he sees things very clearly and in an unbiased way so I appreciate his take and I think he's right I think that
you know people can easily identify several issues that they know Trump feels very strongly about it and he said it yesterday at this Hispanic Roundtable event that he
America First National Security these are my issues you know everyone knows where I stand
Meandering and I think a lot of people have a big question mark on their head still about where
I want you to hear what Maria Shriver said yesterday
you're not unfortunately we have some pretty determined questions and I hopefully I'll be able to ask some of the questions that might be in your head I hope
can I ask a question and she says you're
USPS high priest we have predetermined
now Mark Penn said we were able to have a successful Senate run as Hillary Clinton We want to listen
I would never have allowed
why would you have a town hall and let Maria Shriver have pre-existing
it's out of town hall just say you want to do an interview with Maria Shriver yeah I mean I
sort of bemoan that you know the the town hall environment has become very structured and I think that a lot of you know that I think that it would be good to get back to a format where there is a little bit more free rein I always think of that moment with John McCain at the Town Hall where the woman stood up and said something derogatory about President Obama who he was running against and he said no ma'am that's not true and you know those kind of organic moments we don't see all that much in these environments anymore but yeah that I mean that doesn't that's not a good look at all
but I mean Hallie Jackson
and we'll play some of that after you get back from the
very similar to Brad Pitt when he just she just said follow-up questions absolutely and they're not hard questions
4 years
I expect that was a bit of a all right it's important but I have the framework of a plan got me
she wasn't looking for a
she's looking for an explain
if you're in controversy give you an opportunity to talk I'll have a follow-up question
and she can't do it and I'm just wondering what are they what are they doing
I mean she's a smart smart woman law degree then it's a classic case of you know being over managed or maybe she's over managing herself and she really is so reluctant to stake out
question that she was asked it's been a successful advertising campaign
a couple of years back saying that she thinks that transgender operations for prisoners with taxpayer money is a good idea you know lay down the law tell us what you think it hasn't
the freedom to make decisions about their own
and that cannot be negotiable
we need to put back in the protections of Roe v
rabbit
with you right now
does anyone think the sentence not going to Republic
and you have to say
the matter is and I feel like this is never been clearly articulated by Republicans and I know president Trump has tried to say no goes back to the States now right it goes back to the States so people closer to those decisions it's a classic States right argument they're the ones who get to make those decisions about what the laws are in their own
but this whole thing about you know women's bodies and allowing them to make their own decision I just always go back to the little girl inside those bodies sometimes
and I wonder when the same I would love to ask vice president Harris
so at what point does the baby girls
I love it how
when can you hear
you can hear the baby a baby's heartbeat
when do you consider
that baby a human being that should be allowed to be born
what would she say
I mean I would
to hear the answer to that question but you know what she would here's my guess based on you know just watching her a lot as we all have is that she would say that's between the woman and
you're
here to uphold the law
this is my role as president of the United States and I respect
the decisions of the Court
what about religious exemptions so
am I to understand this if I unless I have it wrong
was she saying no religious exemption so if you're a Catholic Hospital you have to do abortions
yeah that's not going to work
you know we've been down this road before remember the Little Sisters of the Poor
you cannot
make a religious organization provide a benefit that goes against their faith and she always says on this issue
you can still have your deeply held
I'd like to know what her deeply held beliefs are on this issue we still don't know you know and and I just think that even if she were to say
16 week cut off I mean there are many people who believe that that is a barbaric move at that level at
time
but yet she just she's going to Bob and weave on it like she has but I'd love to know her religious she's not stepping on anyone's deeply held religious beliefs and she's going to have to respect that Catholic Hospital so those things have to line up
so I want you to hear what you said about another issue that she really doesn't weigh in on much Haley Jackson
Hallie Jackson should be given credit for
but we still don't have an answer
I believe we should follow
I mean I think you're probably planning to the fact that Donald Trump's campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars they're trying to find you on that yes I'm asking you to find yourself
that that is a decision that doctors will make in terms of what is medically necessary I'm not going to put myself in the position of a doctor
that Hallie Jackson said define your value on that because she's putting her own words back on her where she said my values haven't changed
alright so what is your value she's asking her on this issue now my only quibble with the way that it was freeze is that you know and she talks about the millions of dollars that Trump is spending on this ad but the add shows her words it's a full song by
and then the answer about transgenders rights to have
gender changing surgery as prisoners
in the just in our you know penal system
with taxpayer dollars so I would love to hear her answer to that do you stand by what you said in that ad that you're complaining about do you still believe that
the other issue on this whole big subject is should parents be able to block their child who's under the age of 18 from making this life-changing decision
and I would love to hear her answer on that as well it was a very it was a broad question
and I think she was looking for her to reaffirm thinking for the LGBT community but the two issues are either you know prisoners and taxpayer dollars or kids
do we think
it's a very good question I mean I think on the under 18 thing he's clear he would not allow a child you know when you are
under your parents care 18 years old you know we've seen so many kids say that this was a big missed
my parents get backed into these things by
I'm sorry about you know crazy doctors it's my opinion score telling them that if you don't do this your child is going to commit suicide I mean can you imagine
as a parent a doctor saying that to you
you better do this or your child's going to kill
it is so heartbreaking to me I I feel confident that President Trump would be on the side of you know allowing a parent to make that decision and in terms of in the just in the penal system for prisoners I think you know he's going to suggest they better wait and find private funding for that surgery after they get out yeah I say no on
and especially didn't get to the point
transgender men stopping women from placing or winning
tournaments trophies or
a little bit more because Como Hairston do anything
about Joe Biden we still don't know why technically we still don't know why
Joe Biden is not the nominee remember he was only off two or three points after that horrendous debate where he froze and look like a man
cut 14
will you have to ask him if that's the only reason why
I am running for president United States Joe Biden is
and my presidency will be about
a new generation of leadership To America that is focused on the work that we need to do to invest in the Ambitions and aspirations of the American people
here in pretty much every answer
that she gives
sympathize with her sister on this this is a rock and I don't know what the right answer to this question is either in her position if she never saw anything
did she ever see you know that that's a weird answer right and I never saw any of this Behavior because I never
was to go to Jill Biden and say we need to talk there's a problem here we got to work this out or go to the cabinet and say I've seen too much of this 25th amendment we need to have a serious conversation about this for the good of the country if that was her option
where to go directly to him and say
Mr President and we need to talk about it there's no evidence at all and I think that if she loses this race we're going to hear some a lot of stories that are give more detail to all of this but I just think there's no good answer for her at this moment to that question George Clooney Barack Obama or directly responsible technically have no answer
we're behind the scenes everybody has good days and bad days I'm sure there's days that you can come up to me and say wow she forgot Michigan yesterday when it came to Battleground
but I would I would absolutely say
did President Biden did not think he could do a
as he was coming to the end of his first term he didn't think it to the end of a second term
and I said did you say more than he's ever
remember he hand-picked her but he backed her and she said she's your pick up guys I can't remember
church that wouldn't have anything
takes 2 days off comes back and said my Administration will not be a second by Administration
so that should have been
because you're in a
they didn't realize how unpopular their Administration
and the policies in the arrogance in which they implemented
they said everyone's happy about the new green deal everyone's happy about the chips act everyone's happy about the infr
everyone's happy about the recovery pack they're going to love it when a mandated those vaccines and I demanded you were a mess and I looked out for your safety by keeping schools
okay and you made me give money to Black lives matter we wasted 90 million and you told me we were racist country okay and you told me the Georgia law was Jim Crow 2
okay they
Afghanistan the what happened in Ukraine what's going on with Israel you told the the upper on these campus
what's a big deal I'm just doing my job time for reelection and then she realizes
not only do I have to separate myself
if I don't
I'm going to lose
I can't talk about any of these programs there is that the you know Biden ran as a moderate but then got pulled to the left on all the things that you just mentioned she was already but she was already on the left so now if she tries to go back to the middle it's too late at this point it's tries to go back to being a moderate candid
she's it's not going to be believable at this point so and I all the things that you mentioned are
half of America saying that they think this is too liberal it's not the direction that they want to go in but Brian you know I don't know if these polls are accurate none of us will know until we get past the next two weeks but half of the country disagrees with you on those
according to the
you mean that they're like
it's a razor thin margin from what we're seeing right now if that's not true and if somebody wins in a landslide well then we'll have different conversation but
at least at this moment and I don't know yeah at least half the country feels that way but if she if that is correct
she'd say I am so
are the
I am so
to push you out for the new Green
I'm so proud to subsidize so all those things for her side maybe she would be doing better if she was owning because right now she's all over the place talking about your hopes and aspirations and people don't have anything to grab onto like who are you what is it what do I where am I getting here
I'm so proud of it I'm so proud to undo
dozens of
Trump
crackdowns on illegal immigrants at the border I'm so proud
did that fence is rusting in the desert rather than standing up blocking in Paradise you know if you were a coaching her and you would say you know you need to embrace the future of America immigration you know they're showing you all the ugly things there are a few ugly things and we're going to fix those holes but you know
there's an overwhelmingly good impact of having more people come into the country my thoughts I'm just saying if
I'm acknowledging their 8 million people here and I'm saying it's great
but don't just acknowledge they're not here and say that I prosecutor transnational gangs in 2012 I mean think about those people I always go my mind goes back to Chicago to the city council meeting when all of those residents of Chicago stood up many of them black many of them Hispanic some of them
why are these people eating up all of our services you know why are they sleeping in our schools
why can't my kids can't go play on the field they usually play on and my mind just goes back to them all the time I think
this is people's reality this is what they're living everyday you cannot tell them that it's not happening and that's why she's in a box when we come back with more than we'll find out what's on her show and then ask her how she feels about General Kelly General Mattis and general Millie coming out and saying Trump likes Hitler
giving you everything you need to know you're with Brian kill me
will you say that it was very hard would you
if you know history
if you know history it's hard to imagine Hitler did anything good so
I feel the same way General Kelly talking about conversations he had behind the scenes with President Trump and he felt compelled to tell the Atlantic magazine that Martha MacCallum here your show starts at 3 imagine you get to discuss some of this
and your thoughts about Kelly coming forward
I'm sure he has his reasons I think that President Trump would say well I fired all those guys and that's why they're doing this
they have bruised Egos and now they want to dredge up things that we said you know
that were said in sort of
in the office while we were discussing things so I think it's unfortunate honestly I think it's a little unseemly at this stage of the
but I'm sure they have their they have their reasons and
they have freedom of speech so you know I mean I think most people honestly I don't think they're going to change a single person's mind with this issue
I think
president Trump is a very
man a unique operator he says things and does things in a way that are uniquely him
I think he has to be judged by his actions rather than these comments in a lot of ways I think that the person who said and I can't remember who said it originally but you have to take him seriously but not literally
the approach that people need to take with him for you know whatever they decide is is there ball
but he said he's a unique historic figure there's no doubt about it this is what people said
Trump said this in a private conversation Trump said in a private conversation in the White House according to two people who heard him
say this people who were totally loyal to him that file orders this is absolutely
Pfeiffer Road an email president Trump never said this
so the quote was
you know
number one do I want everything I say in a private conversation public I don't think anybody listen to me does number two
number to number 3
General Kelly and General Mattis are playing
they swear they never do it that's why they got out of
if they didn't like him and they didn't they should have gotten out early instead they sat there and undermined him they thought for the good of the country
which to me is pretty arrogant because the country vot
the other guy in not
I mean I think that General Mattis as you said has stayed quiet for a very long time
I think that history
is on the side of those who don't insert themselves in these these kinds of moments but honestly
I think that you know
I just think these guys feel like they're they're doing the right thing but you can see that Trump is vehemently disagreeing and saying that these are people of bruised Egos and that's why they're lashing out
