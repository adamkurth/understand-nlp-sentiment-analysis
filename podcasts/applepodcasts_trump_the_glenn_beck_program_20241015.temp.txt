are you kidding me are you watching him it is crazy so he had just gotten off the phone with Elon Musk and he's just so impressed with Elon Musk and he so it was a great time to talk to him so we have to break it up cuz I think we talked for like 45 minutes and we talked about absolutely everything it's a great interview We Begin that in half an hour and it will take half of this hour and then all of next hour but you don't want to miss a really fascinating and different interview with Donald Trump we do that first you know it's usually the nights when you need really good sleep a solid 8 hours of rest Tanya is Tanya really does not sleep well and I think it comes from I think it comes from race because when Rafe was a baby all the way till even now he's up in the middle of the night always up in the middle he was three years old and he was learning how to crawl out of his crib and so Tanya is always on high alert and she can't sleep we were talking about just the other day because I took some relief after sleep cuz I really needed a good night sleep and she's like I take this every night I don't know why you don't take it every night and I'm like cuz I don't really need it every night she's like I do and it helps her sleep it's Z factor from relief Factor if you have trouble sleeping this is all natural say 46 percent on your first order it works Z factor from relief Factor 1-800 for Relief 1-800 the number four relief all right I want to talk to you about a couple of things here first of all do we have the Kamala Harris
I know Billy was getting it for us so it's probably an add-on we have it
this is Kamala Harris doing something very strange
yesterday first of all she brings back the pose of The Thinker where she's just standing and she's holding her fist to her face and she's like huh I wonder I'm just thinking
listen how bizarre this is
and here's the thing here's the thing it makes you wonder it makes you wonder why does his staff want him to hide away she's hilarious one last question are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable
900 shows a day yeah he's like double I mean he's he is doubling her at least in rallies and appearances and interviews the guy
everywhere
and she's saying
his staff wants him put his put him in hiding
I don't I mean you want to talk about projection I mean it's it's busy most
gaslighting but if you only get your news from you know MSNBC and her
you might believe that maybe it's the same thing I feel like when they say you know Donald Trump we know he might do if he gets in to become president he might he might prosecute his political enemies yeah I know wait a minute where I really feel like you know when they talk about gaslighting they always use the example of some battered wife yeah yeah he's like you know at home and like you know the the husband's doing something to like change reality will this is this is what it is in an abusive relationship we went through three and a half years with a president
who obviously couldn't do the job right obviously was being hidden who didn't do a meeting with Congress for multiple years didn't do a cabinet meeting for a full year
a guy who in front of our eyes disintegrated on stage in his first public appearance in forever and they had to switch out the candidate delete their own primary and then she's accusing our side of hiding candidates the most incredible gas station you know he's going to persecute his his rivals
yeah you know how they always say what they're doing always they've done this forever do you remember what they said when the Supreme Court
overturned
or or what was it does Chevron defense and they said
president Trump way they Supreme Court
president Trump could use the CIA
to assassinate his opponent yeah I remember that I didn't even think of that until
these assassinations that I'm like good god did they tell us what they were doing then
God and she said that was the presidential immunity really do you cannot the president can do that so stupid of course not but I mean I wouldn't be surprised I mean if you like like if Donald Trump
when's this election just prepare yourself for every argument you saw on the darkest corners of the internet of how
Trump could have overturned the 2020 election to be used by the same people like Kamala Harris and Oliver media allies and they said well this time it's Justified to overturn his victory I know I wouldn't be surprised at all if it's going to
it's going to happen this is like I'm only 3 weeks away from this device I can't come fast enough I urge you to pray please pray for the safety of Donald Trump in this interview I brought up something about safety and
he he's like I don't want to talk about
he is
he's he's under threat you know Biden came out I think it was yesterday
and said you know because we know Iran has said
they're targeting Donald Trump
we know we've already caught one person here trying to Target him or
yeah it was targeting him right
right after the first assassination at
there is
Trump has asked and Biden has said yes
for some sort of military plane that can fly with his
that will actually be able to
defend his playing against a surface to air Miss
he is
we have information that
that's a way that I guess
Iran is thinking they could take him out you can't take out Air Force One because it has those are deaf
but his plane does not
and so he just asked for military aircraft
to fly with his plane to be able to do that
I have to tell you
Joe Biden came out yesterday and said that is an act of War
if they kill him
that's an act of war and it is
that is a really Stark line
in the
so he said it would be an act of War well
gang we've got 21 days
Hawaii just I pray
his plane and he is safe please pray for
the safety of all of the candidates
but the one that's really under threat right now is Donald Trump
please pray for safety
it's crazy
no he's not
hiding the guy should be in hiding and he's not been hiding I mean you talk about his energy levels which are very high particularly for you know a gentleman of a certain age
I would be terrified frankly I asked you about this because you appeared on stage with them is there a moment where you walk out on stage and you're like looking around just making sure there's not a barrel pointed at you and this is right now not now not that is the security good enough around him now so you have no idea I flew in did I say this yesterday I flew in
I flew in right before his
and we had to get special permission from Washington to even land
they
close the airspace clothes for I don't know how many hours
and it went all the way to Washington to clear the plane and so we landed and they were like you got to get off the tarmac right now you got to get on the other side of the gate cuz his plane is coming down
they had
gigantic
I don't know what you what you would even call
you know dumpster trucks these giant Construction
you know that you would put
you know loads of dirt in gigant
truck
and they had parked them all the way around where his plane
was going
I think it's 10 mi from the airport
it took us about 15 minutes to get there
so from the airport to the venue
every single Street had at least one cop car so you're not going on you had to go on the highway and then one Street
to the
every single Street every
had at least two cop cars
at the Block and police outside they
everywhere
when he came back
when when he came in
you know they said Mr Pat can you go into this room for a second and just close the door the president is coming and I'm
so we go and then we get a knock on the door it's all clear
I walk out
there are guys now these are I think this is presidential detail sniper unit
there is a special that nobody even knows these are the guys that are up usually on the White House at the top of the White House
they're a special El
force that nobody talks about
that protects the President
and I think
that's who these guys were they were all in
fatigues that I mean it was military they had the helmets on they had you know and they all had their ARS at the ready backstage
I mean
the protection on him is unbelievable now so clear message to the any act blue donors who happen to be listening probably not a good time to try anything no try skipping it maybe for a few weeks you know no more assassination attempts see if we can get all the way to the election maybe even without another word please please pretty pretty incredible
how do you say there was something else
Bill Clinton and we talk about this in the interview Bill Clinton yesterday
talked about Lake and Riley's
I want you to hear what he said listen to this and not very long ago about a young woman who has been killed by an immigrant yeah well if they'd all been properly vetted that probably wouldn't have happened but if they all probably is not having enough babies to keep our population
there wouldn't be a problem I'm shocked that Bill Clinton's solution to this problem is more sex
he's right on that
but he's also right on lake and Riley what what is happening
I mean Joe Biden is throwing her under the bus this I mean it was like he was campaigning for Donald Trump what do you what do you think about the Biden thing right now do you think
is he intentionally trying to sink her oh wait until you hear Donald Trump's answer on this oh yes oh yeah ok
you need to make sure that your home is safe we are we are headed for trouble
hopefully president Trump becomes 47
and we can clear up a lot of this I'd like to know
has the governor not called out the National Guard
or whatever was needed to take those apartment buildings back
from the Venezuelan game why are they still there
can somebody answer that question why are they still there how many how many apartment complexes were talking about 10 12 I mean come on this is the United States of America you have people taking these did you see the the story in the news today they're now the Press has trying to turn this around of course it's Donald Trump's fault
but they're turning this around to those those were crap hole Apartments
seriously want an answer from the governor of Colorado I want to write him or call him today I want to know why those gangs are still in control of those apartment buildings are we not the United States of America they claimed I mean it was in Martha's police have addressed these issues have you seen the report with the guy who was just beating up
one of the one of the apartment workers just beaten to a pulp it's horrible anyway
you need lifeguard protection in some cities and states now the police are not responding to calls or I'm sorry not responding to alarms
because you know they'll just be tripped and you'll have to call them so the alarm goes off and then you have to call and say yes there is somebody at my house
before they'll respond
lifeguard protection was simply safe does that within 5 Seconds they can act on an alarm 5 Seconds they can even tell the Intruder talk to the Intruder say we have your face

police
Joe please say no please turn please stop this doesn't make any sense they must believe they're behind and they must believe the only thing I can think of is like a meeting where Kamala Harris is like I can do this way you guys keep me out of this I can do this I can I can do a great job in an interview like that I can I can win that situation
okay comma
because every Aid every sensible person who knows anything about Kamala Harris would say good God don't do that don't do that no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no we don't want to do know that's a terrible idea they're doing that tomorrow
that's a terrible idea I can only think of her thinking to herself
he's pissed but he's really wants her to win is doing everything again there is no butt there is no but on that one you think he's pissed yeah I think he's pissed and and maybe perhaps Bill Clinton
yesterday is
either starting to slip I mean I really don't know what that was
but he was starting to slip which I don't think
I haven't seen any indication of that other than his physical health is not good
he's either to either didn't know what he was saying yesterday and it was like oh wait I'm on the wrong side
or he's just distancing self you know he knows what's coming
he knows what's coming yeah well you know what she should have they should have
so they have a space to retreat
I don't know I've never seen anything like it there is something that happens in the consultant class
during these elections
when they kind of feel that Vibe of oh crap we're going to lose and our names are going to be on this yep leak start popping out all sorts of stuff starts kind of coming out in the media behind the scenes about hey will we didn't want her to do this this and this
and they and they are they start cya efforts begin for the next cycle because they got to get the job for the next cycle yep so they can't be on the hook for this they got to have those stories out and it does feel like we're going that direction what are your Vibes right now do you feel Vibes are really good yeah it's Vibes are really good okay coming up in a site we have so much to talk about and next we have Donald Trump part 1 of a four-part interview that will all are on today's broadcast no seriously I'm sure they do

medicine shortages already
China is on our border making fentanyl to send in to our country

welcome to the Glenn Beck program so yesterday I'm on the phone with the president and he says a president Trump
who is the other one by the way do you know yet know we don't well we talked about that in this interview
we talked about
everything in this interview and this is just spur of the moment we were talking about an interview for next week and he's like I've got time you want to do one now
and I like in lieu of the other one and he's like no that one
and
okay I mean the guy is just he never stops he never stops anyway
we talked about the hurricane Elon
the people that are surrounding Kamala Harris election cheating
Bill Clinton and the illegal immigrants with Lincoln Riley Tim Walsh shotgun experience the broken teleprompter of Kamala the possibility of nuclear war China's handling of covid and that's just the first two seg
so hang on for a wild ride this is a fascinating interview it'll run in three segments this one and then next our two more segments
here is
interview part 1 with Donald Trump
Mr President
yes hi Glenn how are you
I'm good I'm good
I hear you just got off the phone with Elon Musk how did that go I did
amazing world all by himself he's a fantastic guy
when I said that rocket ship come down yesterday I said you got to be kidding the way it landed
United fantastic we were we were talking I think he is
one of the great I mean Steve Jobs maybe is in his category I don't think that I think he's the greatest mind and and not theoretical actually doing stuff in my lifetime there's nobody like him yeah and he's a big supporter I know
makes me feel good he knows what's going on he thinks he's the most important election ever so
are you
have you been serious about allowing him to go in and look for cuts and everything
essentially scientists and
he feels that this tremendous
he feels it's there and you know I can say if you could save a lot of money and and make lives better okay you get more for the buck but
he would want to do that but
he would like to do something having to do with the budget
cuz it's tremendous waste oh yeah and so and he's good at finding that I mean the way he runs his companies
I mean it's tremendous
is maybe the best at finding that the people love it when they hear that without making any Dent to get up and make people's lives better actually it really
is is such a statement
that he's probably the the most effective person on the planet of Looking Over the Horizon and then bringing tomorrow into today
and the and the left because he likes you
he is
I mean they just they will shut him down
yep they will they try
you shut him down you shut the country down essentially when you look
oh look at starlink so he had starlink
in North Carolina they called is there any way you could
call and and some great people in North Carolina suffer
and you know they have no Communications whatever and I got I called him
other than this supposed to be good
and I called him and he added to them immediately Now They delayed him you know they delayed him we were actually they put a hold on you know what he did we were on the ground my my charity Mercury one was on the ground we were one of the first people on the ground we were running at
at the height I think we were running 50 helicopters and we had it all you know I mean we had everything we were there with elon's guy when they started jerking his chain they even came and tried to shut us down in Ark I looked and said
you know you don't have a single helicopter here we're saving people in the mountains if you were here maybe a week ago sure but we're not shutting down
I mean it's it was really tragic what they did it's one of the worst rescues
ever and I think in a league with Katrina which was pretty bad some people say it's worse
and then they didn't let him do it I know cases I think that's I think that's one of the biggest things that
you know when you say we're going to take our country back one of the biggest things that I miss is
the the ability to just do things that you feel are right that are legal but to just take control of your own life the the government has grown so far out of control it's in every aspect of our life and it is the problem
Edison nasty government it's a mean government
the weaponized government
and they've done things and you know it's interesting because the people aren't very smart
you know the people on
I'm not on top to see people that's around them they are
and their vicious and their fascists and everything else you can be so it's a nasty group of people so somebody is is quite smart I mean sometime historian
we'll look back and say this was
a genius it was the biggest heist in human history it was a horrible but it was genius who's actually the president
well I think it's a it's a committee of people and they might not even know the committee is they may not even know themselves does that make sense
it's a group of people
that are in different levels of DC
and they surround the man that was not
the most capable person
she's worse than he is she's worse than he
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Pocahontas okay Pocahontas is probably for the left of Bernie I think I don't know how you how you write it might have to go buy your scale I believe in your scale maybe more than mine but but if you think about it you know we have some people and she is considered the most left in
in the entire Senate and not the smartest
not by any means the smartest in fact maybe the opposite but she is I mean when you say she's worse I mean we were talking yesterday to Mike Lee about
you know her centerpiece legislation when she was in the Senate which I think was called Do no harm and it just dismantles religious freedom just entirely dismantles it
we spent a lot of time
yesterday with the Latter Day Saints
some incredible people and people of religion too just people of religion
she's against religion and it's in her but it's in her bones
she's against religion and I don't know how people can vote for her
we were talking about not so much you took cuz we have such a big lead there
we were talking about Arizona
and you know do you take a look at Arizona and I would certainly say in Nevada
and you have a lot of Latter-day Saints Mormons in those areas
88 I mean if we got 1% more or 2% more
this whole country would turn around because if we won those two
we would be an awfully good shape to win the whole thing is as you know so we spend time together and it was it was great and when I mentioned your name
I will say I mentioned Glenn's name everyone in the place went crazy so they like you like you a lot but that was a big audience I it was amazing they're electric I mean I you know you at one point lean over to me and said
what's Your Gut say and you know the you know the figures are you better than I do my gut says you're accelerating at exactly the right time and as I said to you
but for cheating
you told me that we've made a lot of good Headroom or Headway on that
well I think just by nature of that we don't have covid they use covid to
and they did so many things so many different things but just the fact that they didn't get legislative approval I mean that's you don't have to go any further than that they actually go for legislative approval not get it you know like let's say it's a republican legislature
not get it and then do it anyway it was just terrible and
that in itself makes it better now
but they are very devious group and you know it better than maybe anybody and you talk about it more openly a lot of people
they're afraid to talk about it you're not afraid to talk about it now it's well once you've been threatened by George Soros once you've been threatened by George Soros it kind of just everything else is kind of
amen
which is so crazy
it's so crazy
Kamala Harris is cut from that exact same cloth
yes or no that's a way of talking about it you know
I had a tremendous rally the night before the night before yesterday
and it was unbelievable and we and you heard about 10017
honest selection if we had
God coming down to be our vote counter wouldn't that be great if we can ask God to do it that would be the ultimate vote counter right because you'd have honesty but if we had God come
I I think I do great I think we do great in California
I think would win it now you know they send out like 38 million dollars to a 36 million dollars they go all over the place
and then they come pouring back
and
you know when you go and vote into a really good solid state where you have a roof and they look at you and they want your idea even if you're Trump say yes sir please
could I see your license could I see you on Facebook you really can't get away with anything anyway but they don't have computerized machines
do they have a paper ballots and they have voter ID and everything else have you have you talked to Elon Musk about this cuz I think with I mean
you know this we can transfer billions of dollars and not a penny is lost we do it all day long and it's fine
how come we can't get the technology to lock this into place especially with blockchain
so Elon is the number one person for
Mechanical Devices including computers there's nobody and yet he says the only way to do it really safely is with paper ballots you know it's like something right
he said I consider myself to be the world's greatest expert on all such things as this type of equipment right I would say I put him in number one
swing and you can make things to a lot of bad things
he said but you can't do it with paper ballots when you know they believe it or not they have paper now that's actually very highly sophisticated I mean you know very highly amazing that you know when you hear paper but it's very sophisticated but the voter ID is very important and they don't know in California is you know better than I do cuz you talk about it a lot but the California things are amazing with Gavin Newsom where
you're not even allowed to ask somebody whether or not
if you do I think it's like a criminal act or something
we're less than a month away to find out who our next president is going to be that means there is a chance that it's going to be somebody who is
radically pro-choice
let the baby die if the abortion is botched and the baby is born alive
just set it to the side and let it die
that is the truth of what Kamala Harris want
she is the most radical
and on our freedom of speech as well we may lose our right
to speak out against abortion
we are partnered with preborn and preborn saves about about 200 babies every single day and the moms because we care about the moms as well and it all starts with an Ultras
ultrasound is $28 and when mom sees the baby and hears the heart
she's twice as likely to choose life now you can do $28 $140 I think is for five Ultras
your donation of $5,000 would sponsor pre-born entire network for 24 hours helping to rescue 200 babies donate securely just dial pound 250 say the keyword baby that's pound to 50 keyword is baby or go to pre-born calm slash back that's pre-born.com /
don't go after like the White House or like what the White House will be more believable than Graceland the White House doesn't pay their bills that's a good point they actually did go after Graceland and tried to do this home title theft thing on Graceland didn't work

15 minutes of the interview if you missed it last hour grab the podcast will put the whole thing together for you but now the middle 15 minutes in a 45-minute interview we talked about the hidden Trump vote a theory of mine also the Bill Clinton video that came out yesterday about illegal immigration and Lincoln's shotgun experience Kamala Harris's broken teleprompter experience which is very funny and then the possibility of nuclear war and China we talked about all of that in 60 seconds first today's economic environment is really stressful for a lot of Americans the FED finally dropping interest rates there's no better time than right now to put you and your family in a better financial position if you're a homeowner you should know that American financing is helping thousands of families just like yours families who have been putting everyday expenses on credit cards and now need a helping hand to get out from underneath that debt that is piling up every single month with 25% interest for over two decades Now American Finance in the darkness for those who want to show up their financial house could be the answer give American financing a call you'll be surprised at how many options you didn't even know you had from mortgage refused to other form of debt consolidation it's American financing do it now American financing net 800906244800906 2440 it's American financing in MLS 18234 call 800-906-2440 for details about
the the hidden Trump vote
and I want to ask you your thoughts on on something I think there's actually
a hidden Trump vote that is going to come from Democrats
because they didn't convince people of these policies
they scared them into it they taught them shut your mouth and just go along with it and I think reasonable Democrats are going this doesn't work I don't want my kids being talked to buy you know a teacher in secret that's that's that's that's the sign of a predator I am paying more for my groceries I can't do it anymore and I think there's a
a slice of the Democrats that might tell everybody there for Kamala but we'll go in and vote for you what do you think of that so I think the biggest
okay you know you see the polls in the polls have the economy number one in inflation I view them as the same thing in the sense I think the inflation and economy you can wrap them up into
I actually think and I may be wrong but
you know nothing wrong by much I think the biggest the biggest thing that people are going to be looking at and voting on is what's happening at our border
where murderers are allowed to come in and where drug dealers are allowed to come in and just destroy our country literally just right and inflation is a destroyer of the country too but it's a different kind of
it's a different kind of a destroyer it's not as mean it's not as mean as having guys coming in with machine guns I have to go ahead well I was going to say I don't know if you've heard this yet I want to play some audio this is Bill Clinton
today talking about Lake and Riley listen to this yeah well if they'd all been properly vetted that probably wouldn't have happened but if they all probably
I mean he sounds like he's campaigning for you
yep that's that's come a long way you see that's probably where they're going because
anybody comes in just walk right into a country which is in
and now all of a sudden you're hearing people talking about well you know we need people to come in come
21 million people came in hundreds of thousands of those people
from prisons and from
and drug lords and human traffickers and murderers and they're
so we have a problem before he's a little late and saying it because we have a big problem we have people in our country that are
going to be murdering a lot of people
Lincoln Riley
beautiful young lady I know the parents I know everything about her what happened to her is just horrible
but you have many many cases like that some you don't hear about but they're they're Aurora
Venezuelan street gangs have done they form
and they take it over
JD Vance was talking to Martha raddatz by the way it is brilliant
he says Martha are you listening to yourself
you think this little problem is is is is is little there are Venezuelan gangs that are running apartment buildings in America it's amazing what these people will try to excuse
not believable when you say it JD's been great by the way I love you and as good as he's been Waltz on the other side
I mean it's just it's just incredible I know you're I know your son I know I know your son is a hunter you have to ask him Play that video of him trying to load the shotgun I swear to you I mean I'm fairly decent with guns I would not hunt with that guy he looks like he's dangerous with a gun he's never done that
one way or the other if they if they won I guess he was in a horrible pic but when I heard that they picked him I couldn't believe it and he's only gotten worse and she's gotten worse so she's worse than I really believe that she's worse than
so you think that's right you think that's true
oh yeah no well he's angry because
he got 14 million votes and he was thrown out he was this was an overthrow of a president I know this was an overthrow of an American president has never been anything like that before
he won the primaries I
and they came to see him and they said we want you out
I'm amazed you agree to it actually
and you know the truth is she looks better than he ever did he looks better than he did for
for 5 years I don't know somehow he didn't play well as president but
Ron Ron DeSantis in Florida instead of a job very good on their tough job but he's done a very good job
the way she went at him
no that's crazy
Bill Clinton clip I'm just wondering are they just like
cutting her loose
I know I think they're trying to steer a different path now I think they're saying it's not working and we've had
a very good run for 3 weeks and I think they're saying it's not working she's changed 15 major policies
you probably are the all-time Pro I would say if you've seen
any candidate for high office change to it would be a lot oh yeah remember John Kerry I think changed one or two things and he became you know the waffle man
that's right now he did but it didn't work know but she's changed 15 I mean from fracking to Crime to this to that to
yeah we should see all of a sudden now wants to have a strong bord
and she acts like nothing happened you know where was she for 4 years right but but I've never seen anything like it if you go back 2 years just go back into or just go back into their primaries
and listen to what she said and what she voted for
and now every one of those things have been thrown out so I don't know you know I mean let's see what happens I can't imagine you can get away with
but there's another thing it's called competence
and you know she they tried to threat to democracy with me and they tried it all they tried everything
but let's look at now their confidence
the woman is not a competent person and I think far less confident
I never thought I'd be saying it but there's something going on I mean I watched her with the teleprompter teleprompter broke and she kept going that was amazing
no I said what's going on with him
and you've been in television I've been a television we know teleprompters she had no idea what the next sentence was she was saying 32 as if hey prompter person I'm at the bottom of the page it was crazy
if that and you know what she could even say
my teleprompter
but but
a teleprompter is one of the most unreliable pieces of equipment like the crowd we had we had that was a big truck the night before I had 101,000 people and you can lose yourself I figured teleprompters go out
5% of the time and two or 3% of the time where they're just
I mean I've had a blow up the stage you know if it's windy they're not very good cuz they move like a sound you can't they're very hard to hold
it's a problem
you got to be if you're going to be in politics you have to be able to
but if and when the teleprompter goes you know this you've got to be able to speak
and she was frozen and she's lucky that thing came back because you don't snap back it's called a snapback
it's not back for her
she then started continuing to leave I wish it wouldn't I would have loved to see how she would have ended that
well I think it would have been a bad thing and she was she
she couldn't have done the 32 one more time
what frightens at least me is
she's not in control
Biden's not in control and they're talking about changing our nuclear strategy with Russia and I don't know who's making those decisions and
I mean
have you read nuclear war by Annie Jacobsen
that's terrifying I don't know how you would make the decision as president of the United States that quickly
that is the biggest single
when these people talk about global warming and they worry about the oceans going to rise in 300 years by an 8th of an
it's it's like it just infuriates now at the same time I don't even like talking about nuclear right how bad it is okay so you know during my Administration you probably never heard the word nuclear I don't I purposely
and now you're hearing it every single day you're hearing it all the time and you know issues and a lot of food and now he says you're not working I know I know and that will be
they will never have been anything like that the level of power I'm the one that rebuilt
I rebuilt all of our military that rebuilt it at the highest level I hate it in many ways I hated to have to do the nuclear but I did because we have no choice we have other countries we have five other countries now that are as they say nuclear capable
and that's too many that's actually 5 too
the truth is I think I would have had a deal with Russia and with China
2D nuclear eyes their stock I really think we would have had that
all three of us agreed on it conceptually and I think we would have done that but covid came along and we had to fight that battle
and we thought it will never get credit for it really but we fought it well
I got credit for the economy I got credit for the military we knocked out Isis
got the biggest tax cuts and regulation go to that but I never got cut you know nobody knew what this was covid came in it was a gift from China I got it I got to tell you the way they the way they say that you didn't do enough when they were the ones bitching when you said I got to close to China I we can't have this happening
and they they called you a big head and everything and now they're saying you didn't close it fast enough I mean are we do they really believe the American people are goldfish
Nancy Pelosi crazy Nancy she was going crazy when I said if I didn't close it from China then and you know what their 11 people in
and I was the only one that said I wanted
and you had to close it we would have
probably a couple of million people more and and we really
I mean we would have lost millions of people more had I not done that that was a great move but you know nobody knew what this thing was and everybody got hurt that you know proportionately a lot of there was a lot of equals okay they all got hurt China ended up getting hurt very late in the process
almost scared of the issue it has really
you know people died of starvation can you believe that
either forgot or something happened but they didn't unwell them
it's unbelievable unbelievable but I was a terrible thing I have been bitching and complaining about the Secret Service for well since Obama
we have we have not been protecting our presidents rightly I mean my my people have gotten around the Secret Service however I will tell you this
this weekend
I have never seen anything like the security that you have around you now it is
top shelf
and they said that you asked the president for
rocket launchers or something to protect your plane
in case somebody shoots a rocket at the plane is that true
well I better not get into it but they have a very strong security around the plane very strong security
and and they really
I mean they have to the one thing that we don't have is we haven't had a president saying if some country
we're going to obliterate the country because when you say that that's the end of that they won't do anything but
are we haven't heard that and other presidents have is
you know
proclamations as you probably have heard
there were two or three of them issue that way where even Rivals Rivals were being threatened and
a certain presidents were able to get up and say if you do this we're going to hit you so hard that you won't have a country left and when you do that they tend to say well let's take a password
but Biden is not
is not I guess not willing to do that
reversed
and I was where he was and it was you know him I would issue such a proclamation
first let me take a minute to talk to you about the burner launcher
there you are frozen in a moment of time bad guy approaching you and your family things just got really real and in that moment you have a choice reach one hand down in the gun that you carry will take care of that situation or reach the other
you'll end up in trial for killing a man because of you shoot you'll shoot to kill
Oriole incapacitate him until the police arrived and nobody goes to jail but him
that is the moment to decide and sometimes only a gun is the answer
sometimes less than lethal is the answer and that's the burner launch
it's made in Fort Wayne Indiana by red white and blue Americans they love the Second Amendment this company their big big big big big big big big gun guys and you know they believe in it but they also know what a hassle it is and in some states you just can't carry your gun around
this you can go to New York City and you can carry a burner launch

so yesterday I spoke to Donald Trump for about 45 minutes and an exclusive radio interview we're playing it back this is the last segment you can get all of it on the today's podcast Here's the final segment
the Coachella guy who was he says he was a big fan but they found guns in his car I don't even know if this reached you
the campaign says it really wasn't anything local sheriff said they felt that they had stopped a third assassination at
anything on that
no I don't know he said he was a big fan
and I know that and everybody has some pretty nasty weapons in his car but he was away from the car and the car was parked a long ways away but everybody it was the place
101 I guess more than that but over 101,000 people there
so it was a big crowd he was very far away but but you know when you have that kind of weapons in the car it's a little it's not
we're living in a dangerous world this is a world that's very dangerous this is a world that's closer to World War 3
then we've ever been there's never been anything like it and the problem is like we said the weaponry
at a level I always say it's not too army tanks running around the field trip with each other this
this is Weaponry that I know better than anybody cuz I see it
Larry
and this is weapons and weaponry that nobody's know it's not even imaginable
and
we really need smart people and government now we just can't go through another 4 years like we did with
you know I had to run wanting to make a deal they were going to make a deal I would have had a deal done within one week of the election
they didn't have money they were there was no Hezbollah there was no ham
because there was no fighting yeah they couldn't get money they were there but they didn't have any money
and we had a the best situation he could have made a deal in one week
and big part of this is no nuclear weapons right that was 90% of the
no I want them to do
I wanted to run to do great but
I know so many Iranian
Iranians that are now in Living in America that are like really great people smart as can be and wonderful and warm
so we don't want to have a problem
they they were broke they had no money I said help can't do that
and you know why it said they had no money because of my policy and and they would have made a deal they would have made a deal I would have made that deal within a week after the election
and I want I want them to be really successful as a country it's all good but the one thing they can't have nuclear
and now they're like a month away from having a nuclear weapon that's a real big that's a big problem now we'll see what's going on with Israel
cool I think their stock is going up very high
but it's very very sad to see what's happened that that they would allow this to happen if I were president Ukraine would not have been attacked by Russia 100% Boris Johnson just said that did you see the Boris Johnson interview yeah yeah he said the company
the most embarrassing day in the history of our country wouldn't have happened oh my gosh Afghanistan
you know you were you were talking about that the other day
and I I have to correct one thing that you said in Afghanistan again my charity was over we had the we we ran the airport over over there and we had all of the commercial airplanes ready to go and the state department
screwing us and I mean we in the end we got 22,000 people out and none of them came to America because we didn't even trust our vetting but we knew who we were bringing out the the state department screwed us around screws around they actually mocked us at one point and said well you need one more form and they came up with a new form we said we don't even know we've never heard of that form where do we get it and they said at the embassy in Kabul and we're like you close the embassy they actually laughed and said I guess you're just going to have to figure that out and hung up on us
so we finally made a deal with them you said yesterday they they got all of the soldiers out
no sir to get the the survivors that we tried to get out the 22,000 our first plane had to be full of American soldiers that they left behind
that is that is crazy out early American soldiers they left and we were left without soldiers
and they should have taken the soldiers out last season the last night but then I spoke to Abdul
I said no you're not going to do anymore you know they were shooting a lot of they were killing a lot of ourselves and other people
and I had a very tough conversation with him from that point on
18 months and we didn't have one you know that you can't you can't you have to tell the story about the picture you cannot just gloss over this this is one of the greatest this is one of the greatest negotiating things I've ever heard
tell the whole story I had a conversation and it was important to have it and because the Taliban that's where the killing is like I always say Jesse James he liked the bank
and they say Jesse Jesse why do you always go after the bank he said because that's where the money is right
and in this case the Taliban is because that's who was doing all the killing in Afghanistan you know that was the killing arm right
so I spoke to the Head he's still there Abdul we had a good conversation tough conversation
because they were killing a lot of American soldiers and they were with Obama and Biden but they were really killing a lot of
and a lot of snipers
and I had a conversation couple of conversations but I had a conversation
and I don't want to go graphically the conversation was a tough conversation but you can't really repeat it it's not appropriate but but I had a conversation and I essentially told him don't do it don't do it and I can tell that I did send him something that was interesting so you had you had a picture of his house
and you said if any of our soldiers die
I will kill you and you put the picture down and slid it across the table and then you walked out I think that's brilliant just brilliant
well it was a phone conversation but OK Google
but why but why do you send me a picture of my house during a phone conversation
add and I said that you'll have to figure out but we had regardless we had
no problem at all so we went 18 months not one American Soldier was killed or even shot
and after 18 months
they did this horrible move
and it was so bad and you know we also gave up so bad girls one of the biggest bases in the world we gave it up in China's now occupying it can you imagine the reason I wanted
I would never have left that I was playing now making it you know upgrade what happened with Boogum is it's 1 hour where they make from which China makes its nuclear weapons what an
and now China's occupying it can you believe
they gave it up they left at the dark of night they left the lights
and they left this massive thing that cost us billions and billions of dollars the longest runways in the world
anything on it and we we left we we just walked away from
and what a great thing I would never have done that I was we were having a staffed up and everything
we would have left with strength and dignity
it would have been people falling off airplanes
yeah very sad very very sad that happened to the most embarrassing day in the history of our country it was at least in my lifetime
we we left the lot of our arms and everything else there is it true there now one of the largest arms dealers
in the world
selling the arms we left behind
show me a billions and billions and billions of dollars of brand new beautiful equipment tanks
thousands of trucks many of them are played in their million-dollar trucks you know why wouldn't we at least blow them up before we left because Millie was stupid Milly said the same thing to me I said
I think it's cheaper to leave it behind us it would
if you have an airplane and it's new and of course 150 million to build
you're not going to put a tank
jet fuel in there and fly it out to Pakistan or
direct me home sure I think it's stupid to
he was such a stupid guy he was so stupid it was so he had no common sense you know the expression I say the Republican party is the party of Common Sense Billy was a stupid guy
and I could just see him telling that to Biden and Biden believe me
we left all of that equipment behind now if it looks 3 weeks ago they had a parade
running the equipment right down the middle of the boulevard
and all beautiful in American trucks
all mostly armor plated stuff very very expensive to build and very expensive
equipment riding it down like in a parade
talking about the dumb Americans
he what he what he has done to the country
is such a shame between the borders and Afghanistan and allowing
it's like a demolition site the cities are knocked to the ground those beautiful golden Towers
are crush and laying on their
they were beautiful I mean
those cities have been obl
many more people have died
in Ukraine then they talk about you know they'll they'll have missiles hitting build
23 city blocks normal
New York city boxing are big buildings I was amazed at the size of the apartment that's what I did for a living right
and these are big apartment houses fairly tall but really long and they had a lot of people
and they were hitting up with missiles the buildings would collapse just collapse right down to the
NSA two people were hurt no no many many people were killed so when the when the death toll is really said that you created the numbers are going to be much higher than people think you just said something that made me think of and I know you got to go so we will keep this short but the you just said you know what I do is I you know I build buildings and and it made me think of the hotels in New York
that are now trashing their hotels with illegals what's the game here
what what is the owners of the hotels are now operating a different product
so they used to operate luxury hotels and now they operate them to get government money and then making more money than they have 100% occupancy at room rates at higher than they ever
and I have a legal migrants living in the buildings
because you will probably not have a good chance of getting out it's rough stuff going on I have friends that don't these things
outside of those hotels as the migrants walk into these buildings that were
luxury but are being beat up and destroyed their fights in there all the time
these are rough rough people they make our criminals look like babies
but if you have a
we have a veterans living on the sidewalk right outside the main
and you have migrants going into the hotel okay how about that
and so the military should never vote for her
and frankly I don't think anybody should people of religion should
the Latter Day Saints should not that's why we were there we want to get that vote will you please get me that vote tonight
I don't know I don't know it's a very sad time but we will have more conversations anytime you've been a great guy and you've really been I mean this Mister president I do this for my children I will Dornoch for you you just tell me how I can help I will be there

The Glenn Beck program will be right back churches original recipe is back you can never go wrong with the restaurant
I thought that was a fascinating 45-minute interview with Donald Trump you'll hear the whole thing on the podcast today in case you missed any of it but I don't think we've ever I don't think I've ever had that wide-ranging of an interview with him we talked about everything pretty much hit on all the big topics I think this is a really smart approach by the Trump campaign to have him in that type of environment where he can just go and bounce around a different topics yeah you could be more conversational
he was one of the most famous people in the world before he became president everyone knows this and then put him in the positions where he can show that I think is really smart and yet Kamala Harris came out yesterday and said they're hiding him why are they hiding him why do the people why does his handlers do they don't want him out talking what is he hiding what are you talking about so weird he's everywhere and my gut tells me it's falling apart you know that was empty calories at the very beginning that Joyce sandwich empty calories and people are hungry again I want to talk to you about a phone that I searched out myself and since then they they became a sponsor
you know I'm tired of people spying on me having information you know and not just the government I know the government is you know
monitoring things
but I don't want Google I don't I don't want anybody I don't want to the apps to be monitoring and sending information I don't want to be tracked none of it
so I called up a good friend and I said hey
do you know what what's the most secure phone and he said up phone
so I got the up phone it is it's built like a a digital Fortress it's not part of the Apple or Google mobile ecosystems it comes with its own operating system its own app store its own messenger which you can make end-to-end encrypted calls and video calls on you can send files and photos even create secure group chats plus it has a VPN and anti-virus and it's really simple to use I mean it has all of the features that you would have on a iPhone the great thing is this one's not tracked get unplugged calm slash Glenn go there and get an up phone unplugged calm slash Glenn
and if you don't believe me I guess you've never tried to buy or sell a house or both you don't want to do it unless you absolutely have to because it's not only hard it's really complicated and it just sucks in every in every possible way you want to really great real estate agent that can help you through this so you know at least that part of it looking for a house is good selling your house and getting top dollar for it is good if you're looking for a great real estate agent we have some real estate agents that we've got six ways to Sunday we keep this is a very small group there's only I think a couple of thousand of these real estate agents they're all fans of the show and they all have the best practices to sell your house on time and for the most amount of money and get you into the home that you want whether it's across the street or across the country we have real estate agents that would love to talk to you all you have to do is go to real estate agents I trust.com tell us where you're buying and selling and will recommend a couple of names to you for the best people we think in your area it's real estate agents I trust.com

from religious people people who go to church people who believe in the things that
We Believe

he told me a couple of weeks ago and he said it again on the air he said Glenn
the people of your faith what what do we do and I said are they not supporting you and he said no 88% support that's pretty high
he said two points two more points and I am guaranteed to win in Arizona and Nevada or have the best shot at winning he said two points

would change everything
we'd
in my face you know we have this
this old prophecy that you know the Constitution will hang by a thread
it'll be you know the good people who are paying attention that
