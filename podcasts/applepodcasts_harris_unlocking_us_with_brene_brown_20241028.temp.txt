I want to see a few things about the podcast before we jump right into it the first is
I am an Unapologetic
Harris wall suppor
I have studied leadership for the last couple of decades I have been inside of many many of the Fortune 100 companies kind of in this country and around the world inside of ngos worked with military leaders leadership is something that's really important to me and
this conversation is really the conversation that I insist on having
with CEOs and executive directors and Military commanders before I agree to do work within their organization you know if you take a CEO and corporate sector I can listen to earnings calls I can track stocks I can read engagement data and performance data
but what's really important to me is to sit down with a leader
and understand their capacity for full presence
understand their values understand what they believe in
why they're fighting for what they're fighting for and that's what this conversation is
I think vice president Harris has done an incredible job speaking to policy writing about policy if you go to her website there's detailed policy everything from foreign policy Economic Policy abortion
guns the things that matter from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep
this is a conversation about who is she what does she believe in why is she fighting
I will tell you that
in terms of high-performance high-stress leaders
I've met very few as solid as vice president Harris I'm excited to bring you into the conversation
vice president
vice president Kamala Harris welcome to us thank you
thrilled and ready to dig in
we're going to start where we start all of these
tell us your story
and start from the very beginning
I've heard bits and pieces but I want to I'm going to ask hard questions along the way okay okay so I am one of two daughters who we were raised primarily by my mother my parents divorced when I was five and I'm the eldest and my mother had two goals in her life to raise her two daughters and to end breast cancer
and one of the very few women and certainly one of the very few women of color and a lot of my
work on women's health was formed you know
growing up
listening to her and watching her passion about the need for women to have dignity in the Healthcare System we grew up in an incredible neighborhood where
the kids we would ride our bikes
and so I had the blessing of a really great childhood because it was like it was a working-class neighborhood of you know I tried to explain to people
have you ever known a neighborhood where people are they're proud of their lawn oh yeah
you know what I mean
out
Trim in their roses out there mowing their lawn and just pride and neighborhood pride and Community it was the kids of the community
we were raised
where I talked about this which is that I had
and have an incredible family
and it is the family that I have that is by Blood and it is the family that I have by love
and that's how I was raised that you create your family as much as you are born into your family right right
and so I grew up with you know this expectation also
a joke about it we were raised in a community of people that told all of us as kids that we were special
we weren't particularly special but
they told us we were and we believed them right and I think that
in parenting
there are certain things that we do for the children in our lives that teachers do so beautifully that we can all do that is just about
inspiring a kid
believe that they are loved and they are special
and then you create a high standard for them and they know they're supposed to rise to it you know I mean I see you right yeah and I see
and that's it that's it and that's it and then when you do that
do you know how kids are specially you know like 12 and under and you tell them that and they just start walking around with their chest out on their
and that's one of the best things you can give a child
and then you let them explore and you and you tell them they are special which also means and we expect a lot of them so that was I'm going to pause you here okay
because this is if you look at the parenting research
this follow-up piece is
which is not your special
and you don't have to work at anything not your special and you don't have to do anything you're special and therefore therefore
I mean I was part of and I am like this with our kids and with you know I have baby nieces so I just left pieces they're my niece's children and when you turn into like your twenties and then you look at your parents and you're like these are all the things you did wrong right
and I remember saying to my mother
you never took my side
because
if I came home with any problem
and talk to my mother about it the first thing she would do is not oh honey come here let me hug you
oh honey let me take care of it the first thing she would do is look at you and say
what did you do
later
is that she was teaching me and us
reflect on what your agency was at that moment
and what was your responsibility and to the extent that you can
control it don't let things happen to you
okay I have to pause you again here because this is my nerdy research thing
emotion of possibility hope is actually
mostly taught by parents and a learned cognitive behavioral process what's interesting about it
is the positive correlation between hopefulness and a sense of agency
yeah yeah I see as you say that I see that yeah so hope is actually three this is CR Schneider's work out of Kansas hope is
goal I can set a goal pathway I can find a path to it that includes Plan B C D and E of plan a doesn't work
rent agency I believe in my ability to do it
play The Hope is the driver exactly about
let's talk about your agency here
in a way that also requires you
I think it's very important to also in any situation and certainly it's a rule for today among those who call themselves leaders
think about it in the context of reflection
because also requires reflection
what happened
what could have happened
what role did I play and what happened and what role did I play
it could be something where you should critically analyze it
