I see myself being shot every single day no matter
now I just left I was watching something
and they have this picture
you know from the time you get shot with you know and I'm following my hand down
and somebody obviously screaming get down in Spanish
it's either the biggest mosquito in history or I got shot
cuz that's a scary situation
real experience kind of thing I don't know if you've ever experienced
but a lot of people do where something happens it's so big
give me a lot of amazing things happen number
you can call them fans but the Patriots
didn't
are there a lot of shots fired at least
it's a lot
and the crowd control experts said
one in particular said it's amazing because when they hear both say no
the fans break up and they stamp
and they they really Stampede and people get killed from nobody left you saw that with a small group behind me you know the group behind me
relatively small the people were all out
when I got hit I went down and then Secret Service was very brave I have to say they were all jumping on
and the bullets were flying right
and then he got to take it out by the sniper the sniper got him from a long distance one
but this is the Secret Service sniper was amazing and we believe also a local the local police
hit the barrel of the rifle Splinter the hell out of it
but if they don't get him
but if they don't get it you probably have a lot of lot of that we lost one
two were very badly hurt we thought they were both going to be gone and they they both made
it was
surprisingly you know what I think back on it I was on the floor I had blood pouring all over
you would know this better than anybody in the world probably they say when your ear gets damaged the blood it's the bloodiest thing
and it has to do with
if your ear gets cut or damaged it's very bloody and you know you probably would have been more so than like anything else which is surprising
but I was loaded up with blood
but I was
numerous times all over the place
and I said nope I got the year I want to get
get me up I'm screaming where are my shoes cuz my
cat doctor of
when they jumped I mean they they hit pretty hard
they were there fast they were very bright
and I don't know how that happened but my shoes got ripped off
but it wasn't a surreal experience it was
I know everything that was happening it was
did you see the one with my face was just off the ground and the Bloods burn all along

304 WrestleMania
I don't think I did the first one but I
maybe 3 and 4:30 p.m.
and it was a tremendous success it was great and really Dana White and Vince are really two guys
they're very unique people then is incred
but they sort of have some qualities that
very Sim
banana Dennis and an unbelievable job in Vince
Vince preceded him by a little bit but boy what a job he did he really did create just a global
juggernaut with with WWE and and so the combination sounds like it's a good combination so far it's been it's really been amazing and I think they've only really scratched the surface to you know how far this is going to go I mean really a lot over the years you know people

special woman
I know she was involved with the WWE so it used to be WWF
eww
WWE now I guess what time what time is it going on the first thing
you got into the big deal with the I think it was the World Wildlife
and I just think he was like he sees the moment and said you know what it's time for
it's time for a little bit of change and it wasn't worth fighting it in the court and tying all that up being absolutely
World Wrestling Federation with the World Wildlife Fund I mean they were wait I
it was
it was like a whole new face
what kind of a deal with the WWE we changed our branding and and
the way everything looks so it ended up working out for the for the better so tell me what are you doing here with this stuff so you have a big name

and I just I know you got to have that I know you got that tough
tough guy persona and that bravado
I think you know this is good this is fun
and I think you know what you've done you've made politics fun again
and I just think some people get caught up in the fact that
politics now kind of like a wrestling story
and they can't separate
they can't separate reality
well it's so interesting
and I can explain exactly why but so we'll go to places and have a 100,000 people show up and I don't have a card
and I'm not a wrestler
and when I felt your arm I said I wouldn't have been a very good wrestler when you get big strong arms on top of everything else
but you know and I'll get a crowd of 100,000 people coming about politics you know
if Ronald Reagan came back and he went to you know some of the places that I go to
heat up 250 people or 304 that's very very good you know and they do it in a ballroom some
I'm getting
5060 100th people it's
and it's it's really it's like a love of the country
hope it's something going on it's something very amazing
so now we're in the middle of the
started after 4 years
because if I didn't
feel I won by a lot the last Alexa I wouldn't do that because if you got eight of you lost your losses okay you
it's easier in a way
did you say okay I'm getting on with my life
maybe I'll go to those beaches or do what I want to do is golf to be played do you play
I'm frustrated golfer
who shoots it a guy who's got a 3
he could have at least let me put it out there was a secret service agent the guy did a good job he saw a barrel
AK-47
coming out from behind a bush
you guys buried in a bush
very large
and the Secret Service I mean he did an amazing job
he's walking down
and he sees a barrel coming out of a
and he didn't
he started
because he said
and he started shooting and the guy
wasn't hit but he dropped his gun
and he ran across the street
got into a car now listen to this one
a woman
It could only be a woman because men maybe aren't smart enough a woman she's this guy running
he's running across the
it's fairly busy
play
she sees him and
he's suspicious I see people running all the time that don't look so
41 block he gets into the car
she stops her
start taking pictures of his license
and start taking pictures of the type of car it was it was
a van of some
and she then takes the pictures and send
did the
who would do this and the sheriff says
cuz they just had an incident only
3 minutes before
show the sheriff thing gets a picture and he just had a call that there's this big deal going on
and 2 minutes later he gets a picture of a car and a
sent
who would do this I said to the
if this happened a thousand times
how many people would follow a guy that's running down the street
stop and take
and there's some kind of a chip or something on the license
that if they have the license
do you ever know that I never heard of that there's some kind of a deal
if they have your license plate they can find you
they have a speeding down the highway
and but think of
cuz he could be out there and I wouldn't want to have a guy out there that you know just dropped at AK-47
he's got some problems bad
who would think that somebody
take pictures of somebody's license plate because they saw
a woman did
incredible woman
but I said to the police I said to the sheriff
how many times out of 1000
how many times would somebody do that he said maybe none
hopefully
we'll straighten out the country we'll straighten out the Border we have a lot to straight
this has been the worst president in history this is the worst vice president in history she's worse than he
I think we should be in good
we knocked him out now we have to knock her out
we'll get it back and I do it because we're going to make America great again it's very you know we have a mega you know all about Mega Man it's basically make a make America great again
I say this is the greatest moment today I have to say I guess that's right
nothing even close maybe the greatest movement in the history of
but
you know and they're all fans of yours by the way we have
probably 200 million people if you think about it could be more than that
a majority of the country
then I want to see and when Biden went out you know on occasion to say we have to
we will stop Maga we will stop and say
let's make America great again he's going to stop
it's been very successful but now we're in the middle of an election
right smack in the middle right now we're in the home screen
we have a 19 days
put the voting starts you know voting should be one day and should be 19 days or 20 days
you know we have
we have something I think that's going to be special
the numbers are very good
but who knows you know you have to just keep working
and it's an honor to do the show with you guys that's all right that means a lot to us and giving us this opportunity you know we're not journalists and I turn down 60% volume
I have one question an earlier you were very gracious and you met you know you met my family and their their setting over there
my my political interest
title
you met my daughter
what are we going to what are we going to do or what are you going to do if elect
to protect the integrity
of women in sports
continue on with just the fair play
I don't I don't mean to put you on the spot and I appreciate everything what is but I want to put a face to it if you can can I bring my daughter absolutely
wow you're such a beautiful
can you but you still
you don't want to go
wrestler guy like if you were doing that because people do that like your father
right he's a little too much to handle it now I will not
I will get rid of
Men playing in women's sports is in
okay it's insane I mean I assume
I can't even imagine anybody
thinking anything
you have to have borders
you have to have Fair elections
where are the people that wanted have you ever met anybody that said we want Men playing in women's you know I've never met anybody I know there's got to be some kind of a moment
I'm going to terminate that immediately I'll terminate it I'm not going to let it happen yesterday a volleyball player got
female team where somebody transition and you don't think of voll
she
now this
this was a man who transition
do a
and they showed the
and it was
all all girls that were girls
181920 very good place like All-American type players I think a college team
he was up so high in the air and he smashed that
you know you don't see that
put other volleyball players but the best is weight Li
will you see a record that stood for like 15 years
1/8 of an ounce on each side of the you know this one and then some
that transition to a female from a male
have you lifted before
not much no
here we are so that he got you know if they had like 100 lb so he still left him so it's crazy the swimmers to look at the swimmers I mean the swimmers it's ridiculous
and I think it's very demeaning to women
but you know she wants to play sports and she wants to play against women
you don't necessarily want to play against men you know it's okay but you don't want to do it did you see the boxing match at the Olympics did you see the guy did you see that beautiful Italian girl
she's supposed to be a good boxer
she took just a left jab the guys up and goes
that's like a defensive punch so it goes like that
I just got hit harder than I've ever been here before it's ridiculous the corner pushes her back out you can do it you can do
he goes with another left
cuz I didn't even know they have female boxing there were two people that transition
into
both of them wanted to go metal shocking are you shocked to hear that how would you like to play this guy okay he decides to transition I don't think we have to worry about it I don't think we have to worry about it I think you have to go to
Michigan now I just appreciate you giving us the opportunity and and thank you for
for taking care of of of of of women's sports obviously and dear to my heart rate right now
