everybody just wrapped up once again the biggest interview my entire life with number 45 in his own building president Trump talk a lot about the Afghan withdrawal talked a lot about China talked a lot about what's wrong with the country please like comment and subscribe share this with everyone you know much love from SRS enjoy the show Mr President Trump
it's an honor to be here in Vegas to interview you and so you need no introduction but I'm here is a US veteran I served in SEAL Teams and is the CIA contractor and I just want to talk to you about some of the most concerning topics when it comes to the the combat veteran population
good and so I'd like to start with
some rhetoric that's been in the news lately I don't believe it and there's been multiple times where the media is misconstrued some of the things that you say about veterans the latest being
supposedly you calling
veteran wounded veterans should have been shot or wound
suckers and losers
made-up story was made up by a magazine
and I think it was the Atlantic which is a radical left magazine
and as soon as I heard it I said that's
play a terrible thing and you don't get rid of it you know they make these things and they just use it and use it the opposing side they know it's false I had 26 people that said that never happened
who would
a stupid person or a person that's mentally ill
and you know as you know better than anybody I rebuilt our military
we gave 86,000,085 billion over the way to Afghanistan so stupidly but far bigger than even that I rebuilt our military
I had the best relationship with the military of any president
and respect the military more than anybody
and they just made up this horrible
I was
in his massive rainstorm
and I supposed to take helicopters to a certain place in Paris a little complicated I don't want to be too complicated
and the helicopters weren't able to fly the military helicopters our helicopters
and I looked at it I said
not going to be able to fly so I wanted to drive
by the time we
realize we had to drive it was very
and everybody talked me out of going and all of a sudden and it was a mistake I wanted to go and
somebody made up the story that I said that
and I have so many witnesses I have one of them in this room right now he's a witness that I never said it nobody would say that
and I went to one the following day in a big Cemetery
but they said I said about soldiers I think it was World War I soldiers
the suckers and losers and they're
GR
think of it they gave their life for our country
this was
Paris it was an American cemetery
and they said
and this was somebody
that actually he didn't say they made it up with a magazine they make things up they don't even have sources
they make things up out of thin blue like a storytel
and I wanted you to ask me this question
because
I think it's a terrible terrible thing
but they make up
and then one guy who's a very son of a low-life guy he is a low
they got one confirmation
and 26 people said it never happened
Buffalo the one confirmation was the guy that I fired
a terrible stupid person actually that couldn't do the job well
and I fire
any sort of confirmed it I don't know how he confirmed it but he did
it's a totally false story nobody could say nobody would say that and I would say this to military people
I'm the president of the United States I say suckers and losers they gave their
it's just a a disgraceful
storage on and
all I do is deny it we have so many witnesses
I said you know that's one of those questions where no matter how you answer
you lose you understand that I do I can sit here and talk about it for another 20 minutes
and at the end people would even if they have a doubt you've lost just a little doubt they need only need a 2% doubt
I would think that if people heard that I think if I heard that maybe I believe it if I was in the military you know what do they know they're sitting there and they heard the story
put out by this real rag that's failing badly losing a lot of money
and you know it's interesting I was doing a rally and
I was walking past press and some guy shouted to me I think from the mag
is it true you called them suckers and lizards
military in the graves
now that's a loser because as soon as I heard it I said
that you can't respond to
because no matter how vigorously you deny
I mean they have an expression for it I won't use the expression but it's a bad expression it's when they ask you a question that no matter how you answer
it leaves a Telltale St
and it's a shame that they can get away with it and we have libel laws now where you can do anything you can sue you can spend 25 million suing people
and they laugh at
it's a disgrace shouldn't be allowed but it is allowed since we're on a long form podcast and we're not going to take anything out of context or is there anything that you would like the veteran population to know about what you think of them that I love them that I respect them that I rebuilt our military that I got budgets that nobody's ever gotten that I increase their pay because of the respect I have
if you take a look at what's happening with the military
it's horrible under Biden
this this woman this woman is a
she's a communist I guess I mean and I look at action I don't look at words
Define the police who is the head of defund the police now all of a sudden she wants to you know deny it
she was for On The Border she was the Border
and millions of people poured into our country
add different prisons and they're from jails they're from mental institutions and insane asylums are all different you know
that's the mental institution on steroids as you know
and they're from in the terrorist
in many countries
recently
they came in from the Congo in Africa
where do you come from I think 22 people
but many more than
they're acting like their jails into a country they said where do you come from
Chicago where in the Congo jail
what did you do
they wouldn't
we have the toughest people in the world being dropped into a country and not from just South America from South America yes
venezuel
the crime rates down 72%
their prison population is way down their mental institution population is way down to this is true with many countries and that's because they're dumping their prisoners
did dumping their gang members MS-13 that dumping everybody into our country we have a totally open border
and she's a Marxist she's really a Marxist her father was is a Marxist professor
this woman
ran against I guess about 22 Democrats
she was the first to leave the rice
she left the race before she even got to Iowa the
primary State as you
a lot of people followed and Biden which is shocking because he's terrible
terrible for the military by the way but he's the worst president in the history of our country in my opinion
and yet what happened to him shouldn't happen he got 14 million vote she got no vot
it was a coup it was an overthrow of a president there's never been anything like that
that doesn't mean he's good or he's copied it but he did win
and then they said we don't want you you know we had a debate
and after the debate he was 17 points down in polls
and they went to him they said you're not going to win you can't win
and we want to get somebody else
and he didn't want to go and he fought it and then they said I think they're going to pull out the 25th Amendment
which is mental acuity
or something
and he said I'll go now they're trying to act like it was a friend it wasn't friendly he's a bitter man right now
what happened to him
you go through primaries you win I mean you won against 22 people and I think he got very lucky
things happened I understand exactly what happened but he got lucky but it doesn't matter he won
getting 14 think of it he got 14 million but she got none she never made it
to the
contest which is Iowa
and now she's running
okay now I'm not complaining because she should be easy to
this country is not ready for a Marxist or a communist this country is not ready for somebody that wants to defund the police
that said that they will never be fracking in our country if we don't Frack if we don't drill for oil and gas
we won't have a country because that's where the power comes from that's you know we can talk about all sorts of things but
that's the power that powers up our plans
I'd like to
I'd like to talk about the power grid but I like to start with one of the major concerns in the veteran Community is the way that the Afghanistan withdrawal happened we had 13 service members killed one missing an arm and his leg 7.1 billion in equipment left behind
allies in Afghanistan have been abandoned people that we fought alongside with for 20 years we left the intelligence
hit our bases
depict where they live Biometrics everything taliban's hunting them down killing them raping their wives raping their kids
we evacuated 120,000 +
Afghans that are unvetted we have no idea where they're at in our country and now we're sending them 40 to 87 million dollars a week
it's so bad
do we actually
I did an interview with Ahmad Masood he's the leader of the Afghan resistance
we wanted to get in front of Congress to warn us about
the oncoming threat that we're facing because we're funding the Taliban we had made a petition it now has almost 300,000 signatures
he's done nothing
not one
why do you think
Congress doesn't want to see m
well I'm surprised when you say McCall is a good man
but I was so against that whole thing you know just so you know
I wanted to get out but I want to get out with dignity and strength I spoke to the head of the Taliban
what numerous occasions
because they were killing our soldiers
they were snipers
and they were killing our soldiers
during Obama
add a little bit during me at the beginning
and I heard about
and I should get the head of the Taliban in the Press went crazy when they hurt I was speaking to on the telephone
and I told him
well pretty tough
nice
he's still there he's still
fashion don't
and he understood
and in 18 months not one person was killed you know that during my time
nobody would have been
tell me how to rigged election
and they took over
started in a lot of places Russia started to form
along the
would it never happened if I was president
but with the and by the way October 7th would have never happened in Israel because Iran was broke
did no money to do anything now they have 300 billion they made it all in the last three and a half
I said anybody that buys from I just wanted to have a deal with the
very simple deal can't have a nuclear weapon that's
I want them to be happy I want them to have great lives I want him to have a great country can't have a nuclear weapon
very simple and I would have had that deal done within a week after the election but the election was a disgrace to our country another disgrace how but but with with Afghanistan
you had to get out
but we were going to get out with dignity and
we're going to take our people out our Americans that we have people living there you said better than anybody could say it
when you said raping the wives raping the people
I mean I assume that could be happening but can you imagine we didn't take him
the military ran out first it's almost like
they ran we didn't remember this we didn't have
problem for 18 months with them in the taliban's rough they're good Fighters
their ancient fighters in a way their equipment and everything else but they're good very good fight
but we had no problems
and then when this happened and when I was
they heard that the military was gone
and I could just imagine somebody coming back and saying Abdul Abdul the Americans have
the soldiers are
he probably said you
don't ever tell me that that nobody could be so stupid
put Millie was a stupid person very stupid but you know we have great generals but Millie was stupid
guys like John Kelly are one of the he's one of the dumbest people I've ever met
a bully but a weak bull
and you know we just have some stupid people
Kelly wasn't so involved in
we have
really stupid people at
a little bit lower down the non television generals are phenomenal I beat the you know I took it 100% of the Isis CallApp
it was supposed to take 5 years I did it
3 weeks
and we have great generals and we have great military and they're not working you know the people that are welcome that people the top people they should all get out
and I'll tell you another thing I fired a lot of people
when they don't do a good job by fire
I think it's important
Biden's never fired anybody she's never fired anybody
everybody involved in that horrible most embarrassing day you understand that I think it's the most embarrassing day in the history of our country
that's what I did and it gave president she of China the right to fly bombers all over Taiwan you know what she's doing I mean it's just a question of time
although I get in I think it's a different story
but it gave him
the right to do things that he never did with me he never was flying the other day they flew 38 bombers over to one they have the surrounded by ships and there's a lot of bad things are happening there but
whoever worked on Afghanistan
should be fired the general should all be fire
that was the most incompetent thing they left first and they left Bagram one of the biggest air bases in the world you probably know that your military guy
what's the most powerful runways like 9 ft thick and you know
can handle the biggest loads of cargo and everything
put more importantly its 1 hour from where
China makes its nuclear weapons
and we gave it up just walked away just left the lights on walked away they left the dogs too by the way you know a lot of people say what about their dogs and a lot of dogs
the German Shepherds special dogs they left them all they left them or you can tell them doesn't like dogs by the way
but they left the dogs
they left the lights on
there's no reason to leave but they did we did want to get out but we want to keep I want to keep I
and I was set to get out it was enough already I was going to take all the equipment first of all I was going to get the Americans out then I would have gotten some of the people that helped us but you don't want to go crazy with that
and then you know the interpreters Etc
you know the people that got on those planes that was like survival of the fittest the toughest people got on the plane
enemies of ours in many cases and they got on those plans and many of the people got on those planes but they didn't get inside they were on the outside and they fell off the plane at 3,000
which is like three times the height of the Empire State Building
they fell off the plane those scenes of those planes taking
way up in the are going at 400 miles an hour
the people falling off the plain
they don't talk about that
they don't talk about the border and just
bring you up-to-date today was learned that 818,000 jobs
did they said were produced we're not produced
they don't talk about that yesterday it was
reveal 2 days ago it was revealed that Joe Biden
and the family stole 27 million
can you imagine if Trump stole 27 million or two dollars
they would have stopped everything they would have stopped the Democratic Convention they said let's make it next
Biden it was revealed by Congress by committees in Congress I think three committees
confirm 27 million dollars by the family of something having to do with
and you don't hear about it I don't I didn't see any stories about it I saw a little piece on Fox
put outside of that I didn't read one story about can you imagine
they confirmed the 27 million dollars the night that he made the speech
which was a very nasty spee
the hatred he
the people that overthrew him isn't overthrows it was a
he screams everything is
he's like screaming all the time
it's like very uncomfortable
but I understand his screaming is that she's got a disorder
Nancy Pelosi
Barack Hussein Obama
and a group of people went to them they said we're going to
you need to get out I'm going
wheel in the 25th Amendment
what did you think when you got that
I said that he was leaving that he was leaving did you know he was going well there's a lot of speculation
contact with him was during the debate
and the debate was very early if you remember cuz he didn't even really have the nomination yet or you know so
I didn't care I gave up everything I said they gave me a thing they really didn't want to debate they gave me CNN
they gave me
Dana Bash
they gave me who's the internet exactly my best friend
and they gave me
what I used to call fake Tapper but I don't call them fake anymore because I thought they were very fair both of them were very fair during the debate but but they gave me two people that I would never take they gave me a network that I would never take a cable station CN
they said we'd like you were both sit down I said let's stand up okay I was able that's the only point I
and they gave me
all of these are they said there's no audience I'd rather have an AUD
but they say there's no audience and they say we're going to cut your mic off after
so they gave me everything
and I thought I'd reject it I said I'll take
cuz it was the only way I could debate
they were surprised I took
but they still had to go forward with it and we went forward
I wouldn't say he performed brilliantly this was not Winston Church
and he was very white you know he wore a very white makeup I don't know what happened I don't think his makeup artist did a great job actually I walked in I said man I see
but but he didn't perform too well
that's where it started with him you know there was no chance of that happening before that yeah even though I didn't think it was exactly sharp it wasn't The Brightest Bulb in the ceiling is the expression go
that's when it started and then he did a series of interviews to show that he's actually okay and they were real set up interviews George Lopez from ABC ABC's the worst of the group by the way you know they're doing the debate they were going to do the Deb
I made a deal with fox
and ABC and also NBC
he's turned down Foxy's turn down NBC he'll only do ABC ABC is actually the worst of the group
believe it or not
the nastiest
if you're in my line of work which can be a very dangerous line of work by the way I was telling the people at the border they said
there are some people out there that are pretty rough on the border and I said I think so
but I said to him you
it's actually very dangerous being the president sexually pretty dangerous line of work if you
just look at the
number of people
didn't exactly make it the proportion
is very much higher than race car drivers or
15 *
but it's I said it's a dangerous line of work but you have to do it
and you have to do it properly they're saying that you sure you want to be here
I say I have an obligation to be here the borders are very unsafe place
and we have to straighten out the border the borders
who is this Kam
never went to the Border she went to a border that you would take your family and
essentially never went to the Border she was the borders or she was the worst borders are in the history of the world there was never a border so bad as this one
I'd like to go to Russia Ukraine that's a major concern of a lot of Americans have sent over 175 billion dollars we've seen no progress
and so I think a lot of people want to know
when you get into office if you get into office
will you be able to set Selinsky in Putin down and have them negotiate a deal so that we can spend the next $175 billion dollars on our own infrastructure
so let me tell
two count
should have never happened would have never ever happened didn't happen for 4 years there was no talk about Russia going
I knew Putin very well I got along with him actually
and that's a good thing Not a Bad Thing by the way you know people say oh you got along with what the stupid press
some of the stupid friends some of the press is not stupid at all
that's a good thing
he's got 1800 nuclear weapons
show
the biggest risk today I don't want to hear these poor fools talking about
global warming they don't go out that anymore they call it climate change because you know some parts of the planet the cooling and call me it didn't
so they finally got it right they call
they just
climate change they used to go to global war
you know years ago they used to call global cooling in the 1920s I thought the planet was going to freeze now they think the plan is going to burn
and we're still waiting for the 12 years you know we're down almost to the end of the 12-year period you understand that with
lunatics that know nothing they weren't even good students at
they didn't even
they predict they said that we have 12 years to live and people didn't have babies because they said
we only have another no no it's so crazy but the problem
isn't the fact that the oceans and 500 years will raise a quarter of an
the problem is nuclear weapons its nuclear
the level of power of the nuclear weapon today
you take a look go back many many decades and
hirosh
nagas
that was so many years ago
and now you look at today and multiply that
what took place there
300 400
the biggest risk is that always that always that
but we also have some very bad people you know you have crazy Nancy Pelosi and all these lunatics within our government their lynott
add and it's a real problem
the biggest problem we have
and the world has is Weaponry Weaponry of other kinds to not just nucle
what kind of weather is so massive and so powerful and so destructive
Andy's poor fools talk about global warming all the time
you know the planet's going to get
it's going to Global warm to a point where
the oceans will rise in 8th of an inch and 355 years you know they have no idea what's going to happen to the weather
in the meantime we're spending our wealth on this
what would we have we have people Sean
nuclear capability now you have five countries
would nuclear capability that is so devastating it would be obliteration
what would you like to see happen with Russia Ukraine how would you like to see that deal go down we would have never happened
it didn't happen you know a lot of people say well how do we know actually Democrats even say that wouldn't have happened October 7th Israel wouldn't have happened but
I've told people
no Putin very well
I told him don't do it it was the apple of his eye we were talking a lot
and Ukraine was the apple of his eye I said don't do it don't do
I will go exactly what I said in terms of why you can't do it but you can't do it and he wouldn't have done it he wouldn't have done it
but when he saw in Afghanistan
I think that's when he really said this is a time that he can go in and I was
by this time I was
but when he saw Afghanistan
I think that changes whole thinking toward
he lost
for the United
he also has no respect for
who does
show Putin
zielinski
was involved in the
impeachment hoax number one that was a couple of hoe
which I won both of
but he was very honorable
I made a very innocent phone call to him to congratulate him on
one of the people that work for me not the brightest
asking me to call zielinski call zielinski call please call him and congratulations cuz they wanted to do an oil deal or something I said call him and you know for the United States
and call them and congratulations kept asking me I finally I call
and they took that call which was a congratulatory
and they made it into an impeach
and I will say I got great support from the Republicans and the Republicans really in Congress I think
I got $196 out of 196
when did you ever hear that about the Republicans right you know how great support Jim Jordan and all these guys that were
so it was wiped out
but I got to know zelinsky then because
add a news conference or something
did President Trump say anything that was
threatening to you or bad this was the reason you got a picture can you believe
and he said not at all he was very he was a gentleman he called me to congratulate me
said it was a very normal call
now he could have grandstand
I respect him for what he did he could have said oh yeah I felt very threatening and all
just the opposite he said
nothing he did nothing wrong
and
should have ended it all but he was very honorable
I know other people might have done something that could have been different now it also changed because by
the phone call
that was a perfect
and they had already started the impeachment process
and when crazy Nancy Pelosi saw
the phone call which was
great stenographers military stenograph
every word was perfect I am very professional every word was exactly my conversation as it was perfect
congratulations I actually said
if you find any corruption in your country
please report it to the Attorney General of the United States which they have to do you know we had an agreement with them
because Ukraine has been traditionally a very corrupt
I said if you find any corruption please report it to the attorneys and what's better than
and basically I congratulated him on his victory but when he went and by the way when they saw that the car was essentially recorded
they
they said how can Nancy Pelosi looked at this idiot
and said how can you get us to do this you know Shifty shift is the one that sort of led the charge
he made up all sorts of things you know many of them made up statements about the call and it turned out to be totally wrong because when they saw
cape
the statements were total
but because they're in that building you're not allowed to sue them for
anyway
I tell you zielinski was
it was 100% good so I and I've said this before
I will
have that war
when I'm president-elect meaning
before I get to office on January 20
many more people have died in that wore than is being reported I think you know that you're a pro at the whole
thank you get it you know
but that war is much more devastating than people understand
the people freeze to death in the winter you know Rush is
winter fighter they
they beat Germany and they beat napole
and they're a massive military
Ukraine isn't Ukraine
but Ukraine has us giving them a lot of money one of
one of the things that's unfair is
you mentioned 170 or
I think we're into 250 250 billion worth of equipment and money and everything else
in Europe is probably at 75 or 80
and I said they have to equalize why are you
it's much more important for Europe than it is for us we have an ocean separating us
where is Russia's right at their door
and Ukraine is always been like sort of a guardrail who was you know it was
to Russia Russia has always been a little difficult obviously right and whether it's Russia and Soviet Union for a while Etc
problem you have and the
most drug
is all you have to do is say
you got to catch us you know
Europe if you add up the countries is
is essentially the same size as the United States
because of certain things I did were actually now bigger but the economy is relatively the same you know you add up all the European countries and compare
and they should be
they should have paid at least $150 billion dollars more than they
well way ahead of
and I say they have to equalize
but I will get that war set
it would have never began it's so devastating
many more people when you're going to see the end result just like they lied about jobs today
were the 8194
that wasn't supposed to come out that was supposed to come out after the election and they had a leak or somewhere in the
statistical Department
in Department of
what what would you have
invested at 175 billion dollars into our infrastructure would you have maybe put it into the power GR
well your power grid we have everything I mean it's whatever we also have 36 trillion dollars in debt you know we're doing all of this you know when I rebuilt the military
I came
and you probably remember this I thought it was terrible
we had no ammunition did you know that we had no ammunition or Ammunition stock was
empty because we had given it to all these people that we defended that hate us
I came
and just before I got there there were people saying
in our military
that we have no ammunition
I said who are these stupid people that would say that anyway why would you say that
why would somebody say we have no it's terrible even if it's true you don't want to say it
and we had no am
over the first year first thing I did was fill up every storage house
get away these empty storage house they were packed to the gills
and then these guys gave most of it to almost all of it at least now we have no ammunition Again by the way
these guys gave the ammunition to Ukraine they gave
massive amounts of missiles and bullets and everything we gave it to Ukraine
so I would say this Ukraine and in a lot of ways is very brave but if we didn't help them they would have lost in the first
we did help them
Europe's helping also but they should you know they should have done much more
as you remember when I first came in
at the time we had 28 countries
and only seven of them were paid
the rest of them were delinquent they owed the money huge amounts of
Obama would go there and make a speech and then leave which
made a speech and he left I
looked at the books and I said you
you haven't
you got to pay
and I went back the next time and I said you got to pay if you don't pay they said
if we don't pay one of the
presidents of one of the countries
if we don't pay will the United States defend us against Russia in case of a war I said no when it won't even think you mean your delinquent if you're delinquent
we are not going to defend you if you're Del
as soon as I said that the money came in by the billions you know I got $400 billion dollars
why should they pay of the United States
yeah had I said we will back you they would not have said yeah

I know everybody out there has to be
just as frustrated as I am when it comes to the BS and the rhetoric that the mainstream media continuously tries to force feed us
I also know how frustrating it can be to try to find some type of a reliable news source
it's getting really hard to find the truth and what's going on in the country and in the world and so one thing we've done here at Sean Ryan
is we are developing our newsletter
in the first contributor to the newsletter that we have is a woman former CA targeter some of you may know her as Sarah Adams call signed Superbad
it's made two different appearances here on the Sean Ryan Show
and some of the stuff that she has uncovered and
broke on this show is just absolutely
mind
and so I've asked her if she would
contribute to the newsletter and give us a weekly intelligence
it's going to be all things terrorists how terrorists are coming up through the southern border how they're entering the country how they're traveling what these different terrorist organizations throughout the world are up to
here's the best part of the newsletter is actually free
we're not going to spam you
it's about one newsletter a week maybe two if we release two shows the only other thing that's going to be in there besides the Intel brief is if we have a new product or something like that but
like I said it's a free
CIA intelligence brief sign up links in the description or in the comments
we'll see you in the
how many are delinquent men I took a lot of heat from the press for that
because they
is President Trump wants to get out of NATO this look NATO is very unfair to us
because we
far more than we should be spending
torn
these other countries which many of them are very rich
they don't
it's a very unfair thing NATO for us
is a very unfair
but the worst part is
you're up to us on trade is horrible they don't take our farm products
they don't take our car
I said to Angela Merkel Uncle how many Chevrolets do you have in the middle of Germany
she said none I said that's right
how many do you have in
she said
I said that's right you know how many mercedes-benz's BMWs and Volkswagens we have millions
I said it's going to have to change
they take advantage of us on
not quite like China
but not that far off we lose 250 billion dollars a year
Europe trading with
we defend them because the NATO deal was so bad but I made it much better and I got them to pay
and 2% is too little by the way also that you know 2% is
the right
but I got them to pay so we defend them a very bad deal for us we were paying
before I got there I say we were paying 90% of the cost of
90% yes and I hate to use this word cuz you have some
brilliant future soldiers watch
but they screw us
so they screw some trade and we're defending
it's always a one-way Street you know when I came in
we had such bad trade deals with South Korea with Japan Bobby was great by the way he's a great man he got a assassinated
but we had such bad trade deals with so many countries China
I made a great trade deal with John I have to buy 50 billion dollars a year of our product
I don't even talk about it because when covid came in it was such a bad you know I had a great relationship with President she and I will again
but and I don't see
a lot of people think oh you have to be tough with
we have so many advantages but we're not going to have the advantages long if we don't
Get Smart
because our country is going bad
and now we have really stupid people running our country can you talk about what are some of those packages what what are some of those advantages that we have we have economic advantages
we have very big powerful companies
we have companies that were formed a long time ago when we had
entrepreneurship was very important today everybody wants to give everything away you know I reduced taxes in our country the largest tax cuts in history largest regulation Cuts in history that's why I had the best jobs anybody that we had to bounce back after covid but we had just prior to covid coming in
we did better on the economy than the countries ever done ever in his history not even close
and we did a great job in covid I never got the credit I always got credit for the military
I got credit for Isis and the Middle East
getting rid of the worst some of the worst Terr
in the history of the world you know that
when I hand it over when had that horrible election
which was a much better election United again much better in the second time they did the first
but this time I think we're going to do better than both of them by far think is more enthusiasm because they see how stupid they are
you know they didn't know that
the incompetence open
we don't know each other but I look at you
can you imagine somebody say
we want open borders so the entire world can release their prisoners into our country why are they allowing
because Biden
camil
and all of these people
they want it I called her
I have different names you know it's very interesting
very very interesting
there's so many names you can call her
but the most important name
she's a mar
that's her ideology
she wants to destroy our country
are they doing this for the
every single thing
you know where they come from okay every single thing that she believed in her whole life
Define the police you know she was a Defender big Defender
she was somebody that bailed out all the people that destroyed Minnesota and Minneapolis during the riots
she literally
raise money to get these absolute thugs out of jail
and this is a woman
Define the police when you're at the front of the police that's about maximum okay then you don't get worse
no drilling of oil of any kind that means Pennsylvania goes bankrupt because Pennsylvania is the biggest
just about the biggest fract
and it's it's a big percentage of their
economic wealth and their employment about 500,000 people
Pennsylvania I can't imagine anybody from Pennsylvania voting for
this person
but this is a person that shouldn't have been there she she tried to get there
the craziest
and I think she's going to fail because this country is not ready
from Marxist I call a comrade
because she's you know that's a connotation
this country is not ready for a mar
as a president or a communist as a president she may have gone into that she skipped the Socialist you know that was skipped over
issues Beyond
we're not ready for that
let's talk about the assassination attempt on your life
who's another one I saw today
volume 10% sure it wasn't quite the same thing they had somebody that they took in
you bet that wasn't a bullet going at 4,000 Mi an hour at you you know where
is this coming from I mean we look at the context there's a lot of speculation about this but if you look at context
the media has been against you then there was Russia gate then there was the impeachment then they kicked you off all of your social media platforms they prosecuted you and the last was
there was an assassination
what's this really a loan
do you know in history of your study history would you do probably more so than I
they say Andrew Jackson was the president that was
the most tormented
as a president they really went after
second was Abraham Lincoln
but he had the Civil War so you would maybe expect that
and now people are saying but nobody sluss think of it
I won with the impeach me twice that's crazy Nancy Pelosi
she's no good bad so bad for the country
an evil person
a sick person I think she's a very sick person
but that
is a large portion of the Democrats like Adam Schiff Adam Shifty
he'll probably be a senator
and he's just a bad guy you know he's a bad guy
are there a lot of bad people over there
I think I can say that there's never been a president treated like this now
the reason I'm being treated like this is I want a strong military I want to border I want you know I want things that you would like I want
low taxes I want great jobs I want to make America great again all of these things
nobody cares about B
nobody cares about bush
nobody cares
a lot of other
I rebuilt our military
I cut regulations more than anybody in history
I'm against destroying
country based on
environmental things
I'm not sure what did they just not true they want to destroy our country
they are called Environmental extremists
and I don't know if they actually believe you know it's interesting
they don't want us to produce any energy any you just you know
they want our country to go to
in your China's building a cold
every single
and Cole is okay they actually have methods now with Cole becomes clean call All right but think of it
through the air current
we can have the cleanest country they can give
they can give up the cows what's it like
you know the cows they want to give up no more meat they are no one cares they don't want cat
they can do everything perfectly
vagina
was that that are
over a period of about 4 days
close right over the United States so what are we doing
and John Kerry would go over there
in his you know privately
airplane his wife was a Heinz married to Heinz
then she's wealthy and have a beautiful plane and he'd fly over there
and spewing whatever they spe
parade
president
can you talk about the environment
in president XI
great players a great poker play
and he was very nice talking to oh yes we are working very hard way not going to do anything just words
but think of
that flows the garbage
the garbage flows down the Pacific into the Pacific you know the garbage
goes right along our West
we take tons and tons
of garbage from China and other Asian countries out of the water
we don't talk to him about it we don't charge them anything
you had mentioned it's so unfair
you had mentioned that
China's producing a new coal plant power plant every
how are we going to if you get in he's also said that the
race for AI whoever achieves that will be will achieve global domination
how are we going to compete with China in the artificial intelligence space
if we don't up our energy production if somebody like this Marxist gets in
I really don't believe it can happen when she's exposed I don't I can't imagine but if that happens we're not going to be able to
with anything
yes you know we were energy independent with me first time
and will soon going to be energy dominant we have more oil and gas
I called Liquid Gold under our feet than any other country more than Saudi Arab
way more than any other country more than Russia
we're going to be energy Dominic but we're already energy we didn't need anybody's energy we didn't need our ships going through
areas near the
Arabic world where the ships get blown out of the water we didn't need anything from anybody
were energy independent nobody can believe it get away with their energy dominant think of
AI is important than other things are important but a
do you know that
you will need
more energy electricity what they need is electric
that specific
you will need more electricity than we have right now for everything for see the strip behind us and this big building
edit all up everything in the United States
you'll need double the energy that we produce right now just for that one industry if we're going to be
the big player and dominant and we're not going to be the big player than China is going to take over that industry very easily
the problem is so we have to produce massive electricity that we don't have
but the environmental impact statements won't allow us to do that
the rules and regulations that we currently have won't allow us to do any of it not even a tiny fraction
but if I'm president will be able to do it
and we'll do it through natural gas which is clean
and we'll do it through
primarily natural gas and
nuclear nuclear
it's become very good very safe and you build a smaller plants and you attach them
but nuclear is very powerful very good
the wind doesn't work it's very expensive kills the birds destroys everything around it is very very very very very very very very bad it's the most expensive energy wind and then every 9 years you have to replace the turbines you know they're made out of steel and they wear out
but we will
tremendous electricity for a company for a country
and that will allow
AI to
and you're right whoever gets that it's going to be a big Advantage you know that's going to be sort of the oil of the future
and we have to be the main player would you I read that
Elon Musk said that he would accept a position in your cabinet would that have to do with artificial intelligence if he chose
have a great relationship
needs a totally unusual character do you know anyone I don't he's
any smart
we have to cherish our Geniuses you know we don't have too many of them
but he is a brilliant guy
and what he really would like to do is
get involved in cutting some of the
and he does know how to do
he loves the country you know it's just an amazing thing we had a conversation the other day
you would know better than me but I hear it at hundreds of millions of people I heard it
the biggest audience that there's ever been I mean would you say that's the correct sentence has never been anything even close
I heard 750 million people I
numbers that are
and
yeah he wants to be involved now look he's running big businesses and all that so he can't really I don't think it would be cabin
I put them in the cabinet absolutely but I don't know how we could do that with all the things he's got going
he can sort of as the expression goes cons
with the country
and give you some very good ideas like an AI there's nobody knows more about it than Ella it's a big you know big
and he said it's very important to me it's very important for the country if we don't do it shine it's going to do it or somebody else but most likely China
in China is working right now to develop massive electricity
a flood of electricity a massive flood of electric
and we don't because we have people that don't even they're not even thinking about that and you have to
we have to win this election this election is going on November 5th will be the most important day
my opinion in the history of our country because of our country goes
the wrong way with this election I think this country is do
what do you think your biggest challenge is with being elected
will a weaponized government they've tried that one and that drove me up actually actually actually drove me probably saying that it drove me up I don't know how many points but I drove
considerably the people don't buy it
but they've weaponized God but we've never done that before
The Vicious people these are vicious people you know I could have done that to Hillary
she was totally what she did was so bad
she got a subpoena from the United States Congress and she destroyed everything
you go to jail for that for years and if you did it as a private person you go to jail
she destroyed everything and I said
wouldn't it be terrible I had won the race
there wouldn't it be terrible
do I have the wife of the president of the United States a former president of the United States being put in prison
and I meant that I think it would be terrible
and I could have pushed that very easily
kids out of the op
and now they come after me I say always in that nice these are vicious people they're vicious people
but they're not talented people other than in that way
in that way they're talented they're very talented on cheating in elections
they're very talented on
but they're not talented in terms of
policy
we want to have strong borders
we want to have great elections we want a free and fair elections
we want to have incentive so these great companies don't move you
you're talking about doubling taxes cuz I gave the biggest tax cut in
then I want to double and triple and quadruple and even
terminate the taxes that I gave the big tax cuts which
Lyft taxes in this country
four or five times so people and I mean middle income people would be paying four or five
they would be paying much more money
but what would happen then if they did that Jonas you know these are international companies that may be based here now but they're basically International companies they'll leave the United States
they'll take their job so go someplace
every company in a lot of the pharmaceutical companies went to Ireland
a lot of people didn't know that
but they went to Ireland because they were given these massive text
these companies can get up and they can go
and will lose these companies they'll go when you can say we're going to have you pay 50% tax and all
I got it down from 49% down to 21%
and it was the greatest job boom anyone's ever seen an interestingly the tax rate was
and yet the country took in more Revenue
with with lower a lower rate we took in more Revenue than we did when it was high because the incentive was so
and I incentivize companies to bring the money back offshore to bring the money that billions trillions of dollars
like 3 and 1/2 trillion
but there was no way to get it back there was no mechanism
and the tax and the penalty was
and I reduce that and I got apple as an example brought in 5
billion
companies that are bringing their money back into the United States using it to Bill
but if you don't do if you don't take care of these people they're going to go to another country their International companies
in China want
and all of Europe wants
and we can be the tough guy like this
this person that should not be really running for president
it's very dangerous thing to have a
person running for president with the views that she's got you know when you're a politician and you come out with something early that's usually Where You Are
so she came out with all these different things open borders to fund the place called that's where her thinking is that's where she is that's how she grew up
we're running out of time and I have two questions that I think are very important one
once again the media construes what you say
everything I read says that the one of the biggest challenges in Europe in the upcoming election is going to be the women
I think a lot of people think that is because of the rhetoric that
they're saying about your stance on abortion so I'd like to get
your stance on abortion unfiltered uned
so you have real V
for 52 years it was in the federal government
democrat-republican everybody nobody wanted it
the great legal Scholars nobody want everybody wanted it out and they wanted it to be back in the States
there wasn't discussions about
16 weeks and all the different discussions you
it was just it had to
it had to be a state's thing
I'm for exceptions Ronald Reagan was for exceptions for the life of the mother raping and
and most people now are for most Republicans are for exceptions the exception in other words the
I was able to do something that nobody thought it was possible
get it back to the States
and the states now
and people can make their own decisions within the states this is where every legal scholar every Democrat every Republican wanted it Roe v Wade you've heard this was
legally very
I'm a very bad place to have it in the federal government for a lot of
I got
three great justices that I put unloaded Plus
in my opinion great justices
they got it
and now it's in the states and if you take a look at Ohio recently vot
in a very liberal fashion I must tell you
Kansas voted in a very liberal fashion but some will be more liberal and some will be perhaps more conservative you know
you're going to have a thing that was ripping our country apart Roe void was ripping our country
and it's now being settled at the state
a lot of people are praising it a lot of great
lawmakers the
and it's working out and states are
the coming up with
negotiations and they're doing it and a lot of reasons why this is the right way to do it but Roe v Wade was always considered to be something that just shouldn't be there in the federal government
if you look at what's happening and all of these votes that have been
and others are being taken Florida is being voted on now
it's all happen
it's it's very interesting you're going to have something that was tearing our country apart for years this is all they talked about Roe v
it's going to be done by the states and that's what's happening right now
and basically the people are going to be voting on
and that issue has become a much smaller issue
since this is originally happened when everyone said oh you take it away the
dual
okay now one as far as women are concerned
I think they like me
you know what they like
because I'm going to give them Safety and Security
I'm going to give them safety at the border we're going to have a close buddy you know we had very few people I had the record
I wish I had it I have the graph of my all-time favorite graph cuz that's when I turned over
when I turned over to say let me see the graph I turned over
this was a graph
immigration
and but when I made that right turn you know the bullet came
and it whacked my
there's only my
it was a bloody mess you know I never realized that they told me at the hospital I said why so much blood they say when the ear gets hit it's the bloodiest part of the body I didn't know that because of cartilage the doctor gave me a little lesson in medicine
which I don't know if I wanted to listen to that particular time but I was bleeding pretty badly but I did say why so much and the ear
I don't know if you've ever heard that but it's
you can hit other places you don't bleed as much so
but I turned to the right
look at the chart and if I didn't turn to the right very strongly you saw that I was looking and went this
if I didn't know I wouldn't be here but that's just the lowest the best
you know numbers we've ever had in terms of illegal immigrants coming into our country and by the way
I want people to come into our country I want people we need it for labor for a lot of reasons but I wanted to come in Legally I don't want to take the prisoners I don't want to take gang members I don't want to take people that are going to be nothing but
put women I believe
like me because
they feel very strongly that I'm going to give them better security with the military with the borders with the police
can I have a I have
the endorsement of almost every major police group in the United States right now
I have one last question
I think that one of the
biggest problems within the country is the distrust in the United States government
I'm one of them I have zero trust in any government agencies have zero trust in our Congress and are sent anything
are we having a government that's not functioning right now
how are you going to gain the trust back of the American people within the government
are we going to see anybody held account
the answer is yes on the 2nd they're going to be held
there's got to be held accountable what they're doing they're destroying this country they're crooked people
did dishonest people they're going to be held account
what I find is so when I came to Washington and I wanted an election that everybody
I thought I was just going to have some fun everyone
the greatest
I went from that to
having bullshit at me okay I had the greatest
and they said would you do it again I said without
because we're going to save the country that's much more important than I had a good life that's a lot of people have a good life like not the same
we're going to say we're going to make America great again literally we're going to make America greater than ever before if we don't do it this time we'll never be able to do it it'll be too late it'll be too far gone but
we're going to
have great people when I came in originally I didn't know anybody in I was only there 17 times you may have heard me say this I never stayed over I built a hotel in Pennsylvania Avenue which was a great hotel and very successful
and then
and then what happened is
I wasn't I was in New York person I wasn't like a Washington DC
and all of a sudden I'm president that I'm driving down Pennsylvania Avenue with more
police and motorcycles
military that I've ever seen before in my life I said to my wife you believe
the
but I didn't know anybody in
I had to rely on people to give me names
I had great trade people I had some great people
but I also pick people that in retrospect I wouldn't
but now I know
Smart Ones to dumb ones the weak ones
the solid ones
the ones like you
I know the people I know everybody sort of like
we're going to have a great government
I didn't know I had to rely on people to
I don't want to use names cuz I don't want to embarrassing that bad people but I'd ask people that were rhinos
who do you recommend for such and such a position
all important position
and they recommend some people that were rhinos or something or weak or not good
I have to ask too much right now I know the people and I've known him through fighting and Wars I've known them through cuz all this stuff
I had great support don't forget
I beat Nancy Pelosi I beat all these people
every
did somebody said you know if you look at it
the Clinton family
and that was really Obama too because he was behind her 100% like he was running
and I beat the Bush family
now I beat Biden I got him out
I beat him the first time but
now I beat him a second time because it was the debate that got him
and now I have to beat somebody that nobody ever heard of who's a mar
and I think I'll be able to do that
I know the people now I've been in government now
8 years I was in government for no years I mean I became president than I said
I've never done this before it's pretty you know sort of a miracle you know in the history of our country
we had 92% politicians become president
and 8% generals
not ADM
what's the generals only generals so those were the only two politicians and Generals
George Washington
Dwight Eisenhower actually he was very good very strong on the borders Eisenhower was strong on the borders of moderate guy but very very strong on the borders he had big deportation
but 92% was
politic
in 8% there was nobody else
then I came
and so people were surprised
but I know
the system I know the people I know some great people and I know some people that I wouldn't put in
would you learn that and so now
a very experienced guy
and we're going to bring our country back and we're respected we're going to be respected again with other countries don't forget I had no Wars
how did I defeated Isis but that war was already started that war was raging for 20 years before I got there and I ended that
three or four
you know a lot of people give me credit even people that don't love me as being a great president because we did a lot right to try I got right to try for people that are terminally
where they can use space
Madison Square
the best labs in the best doctors in the world
but you couldn't use it because
you know I just couldn't use it you weren't allowed to use it and I got that done where you can use these Space Age that won't be approved by the FDA for a long time maybe four or five years and I've saved thousands and thousands of lives but now I know the system and I know Washington and none of the people and
I hope we win and if we do when we're going to make this country greater than ever before
Mama's president
it was an honor to interview you and I really appreciate the time and
do you have any words of encouragement
African American
will I do I just think the most important day as I said in the history of our country is November
lot of it's early voting all of that so you know which is another crazy thing where we you know you vote for months ahead of schedule the whole thing is crazy but we want to go to the same day
voter ID proof of citizenship and paper ballots is very
and we want
legitimate we don't need
computers in the sky
we want to have we got to bring our voting
but I just said the American people get out and
you're going to be really happy we're going to be safe
we're going to be respected again and you're going to be very happy I'd like to close out with one thing and that's just my message
not everybody votes and not everybody's going to vote
Sylvia voter grab a friend
very much
any other great Americans
they have to get out and about this is going to be the most important election in the history of our country I believe I believe that too and I wish you the best of luck thank you very much thank you so much
