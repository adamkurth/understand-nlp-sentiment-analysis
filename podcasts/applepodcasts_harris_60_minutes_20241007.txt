go tonight only the Democratic ticket sat and answered our questions
you want to expand the child tax credit yes I do you want to give tax breaks to first time home buyers and people starting small businesses
how are you going to pay for that
my economic plan would strength in America's economy
the question was
how are you going to pay for
what are your fears for this coming election day that will be doing this again for another 4 years
Steven Richard is a Republican election official in the swing state of Arizona
who has spent nearly four years fighting to convince fellow Republicans that the 2020 election wasn't stolen how did they react to you not well
not well at all I'm Leslie Stahl I'm Bill
I'm Anderson Cooper I'm John wertheimer Vega I'm Scott Pell
those stories plus we remember the terror attack on Israel one year ago
and address president Trump's absence
on 60 Minutes
it's been a tradition for more than half a century
that the major party candidates for president sit down with 60 Minutes in October
in 1968 it was Richard Nixon in Hubert
this year vice president Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump
accepted our invitation
but unfortunately last week
Trump
the Trump campaign had told us that the interview would be this past Thursday at Mar
they also asked us whether we would meet 78 year old Trump in Butler Pennsylvania
where he was grazed in an assassination
we
on September
Trump's communications director Steven Chung sent a text that read
I'm working with our advanced
to see logistically if Butler would work
in addition to the sit
sit down meaning the interview in Florida
Days Later Chung called to say
the president said yes
then a week ago Trump back
the campaign offered shifting explanations
first it complained that we would fact check the
we fact check every
later Trump said he needed an apology for his interview in 2020
Trump claims correspondent Leslie Stahl said in that interview
that Hunter Biden's controversial laptop came from Russia
she never said that
interviews because she can't handle
he had previously declined another debate with Harris
so tonight may have been the largest audience for the candidates between now and election
our questions addressed the economy immigration
Reproductive Rights and the wars in the Middle East in
both campaigns understood this special would go ahead
if either candidate backed
and so with that
here's bill
Kamala Harris has been a candidate for president for just two and a half months
and the post convention honeymoon is
with the election just 29 days away
Harris and her running mate Minnesota Governor Tim
face unrelenting attacks from Donald Trump and the race remains extremely close
we met the 59-year-old vice president this past week on The Campaign Trail and later at the vice president's residence in Washington DC
we spoke about the economy and immigration Ukraine and China
but we began with the escalating war in the Middle East
one year after the Hamas terror attack on
the events of the past few weeks have pushed us to the brink if if not into
and all the regional war in the Middle East what can the US do at this point to stop this from spinning out of control
well let's start with October
1200 people were Mass
250 hostages were taken including
women were brutally
as I said then I maintain Israel has
a right to defend itself we would
far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed
we Supply Israel with billions of dollars in military aid and yet prime minister Netanyahu seems to be charting his own course
has Preston to agree to cease
he's
you urged him not to go into
does the US have
no sway over prime minister Netanyahu the work that we do diplomatically
with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing
Pursuit around making clear our principles but it seems that prime minister Netanyahu is not listen
we are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this word
do we have a real close Ally in
prime minister of
with all due respect the better question is do we have an important alliance between
the American people and the Israeli people and the answer to that question is yes
while the war in the Middle East has dominated recent headlines it's the economy that most concerns American voters this election year as always there are lots of signs that the American economy is doing very well
better than most countries I
but the American people don't seem to be feeling
groceries at 25% higher
and people are blaming you and Joe Biden for
are they wrong
we now have historic low unemployment in America among all groups of people
we now have an economy that is thriving by all macroeconomic measures
add to your
prices are still too
and we need to deal with it which is why part of my plan you mentioned
pardon my plan is what we must do to bring down the price
Harris says she'll press Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries but details are yet to be
you want to expand the child tax credit yes I do you want to give tax breaks to first time home buyers and people starting small businesses but it is estimated by the nonpartisan committee for responsible for federal budget
that your economic plan would add 3 trillion dollars to the federal deficit over the next decade
how are you going to pay for that okay so the other Economist that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy
here's what
Isabel
when you invest in small businesses
you invest in the middle class
and you strengthen America's economy small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy not a vice president the question was
how are you going to pay for
I'm going to make sure that the richest Among Us who can afford it
pay their fair share in taxes
it is not right
that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax
then billionaires and the biggest corporations and I plan on making that fair but we're dealing with the real world but the real world
they know exactly what I'm talking about because their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about
their constituents are
those firefighters and teachers and nurses their constituents are middle-class hardworking folks and Congress has shown no
inclan
to move in your direction I disagree
there are plenty of leaders in Congress
who understand
that the Trump tax cut
blue
are federal
none of us and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy
let me tell you something I am a devout public servant you know that I'm also a capitalist
and I know the limitations of government
Kamala Harris has been in government for decades she was first elected San Francisco district attorney in 2003 then California Attorney General
she went on to the US Senate and now Vice
a registered voters still
they don't know you they don't know what makes you
why do you think that is what what's the disconnect
it's an election bill
I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote this is an election for President of the United States
no one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a canned
an automatically receive support you have to earn
is that you have changed your position
on so many things
you are against fracking now you're for
you supported looser immigration policies now you're tightening them up
you're for Medicare for all
no you're
so many of the people don't truly know what you believe or what you stand for and I know you've heard that
in the last 4 years I have been vice president United States
and I have been traveling our
and seeking what is possible in terms of Common Ground I believe in building consensus
we are a diverse people geographically regionally in terms of where we are in our background
and what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus
where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing as long as you don't compromise your values
Define common sense soul
and that has been
over the past four years the Biden Harris approach has been inconsistent and Republicans are convinced immigration is the vice president's Achilles he
you recently visited the southern border and embraced President Biden
recent Crackdown on Asylum seek
and that Crackdown produced an almost immediate and dramatic
decrease in the number of
border crossings if that's the right answer now
why didn't your Administration take those steps in 2021
the first Billy proposed to Congress
what's to fix our broken immigration system
knowing that if you want
to actually fix it we need Congress to
it was not tack
fast forward to a moment
a bipartisan group
of members of the United States Senate including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate got together came up with a border security
well guess what happened Donald Trump got word that this bill
was a foot and could be
and he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem so he told his buddies and Congress
kill the bill don't let it move forward I've been covering the border for for years
and so I know this is not a problem that started with your Administration
there was an hist
of undocumented immigrants coming across the border the first three years
of your Administration is a matter of fact arrival
quad
from the last year of President Trump
was it a mist
to loosen the immigration policies
as much as you did it's a long-standing problem
and solutions are at hand and from day one literally
we have been offering Solutions
was it a mistake to
kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place
the Pollack
that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem not promoting a problem
and the numbers today because of what we have done
we have
the flow of illegal immigration by half we have done that the flow of fentanyl by half but we need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem
you have accused
Donald Trump of using racist tropes
when it comes to Haitian immigrants in Springfield Ohio when it comes to birtherism when it comes to Charlottes
in fact you have called him a racist and
did Donald Trump has the support of millions and millions
how do you explain that
I'm glad you are pointing these comments out that he has made that have resulted in a response by most reasonable people
it's just wrong with so many people supporting Donald Trump
man you've called a
how do you bridge that seemingly
unbridgeable
I believe that
the people of America want a lead
I believe that the American people
recognize that the true measure
of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down
it's based on who you lift
the Harris campaign has been hopscotching the country and with less than a month to go the pace is picking up
the vice president told us she has lost track of how many states she's visit
how you doing I'm doing well we joined her on the trail late last week and the crucial swing state of Wisconsin in the town of Ripon the birthplace in 1854 of the Republican party and at a rally plastered with country over party banners Harris appeared with staunch conservative Liz Cheney as Vice chair of the house January 6th committee Cheney became one of Donald Trump's fiercest critics
I have never voted for a Democrat
I am proudly casting my vote for vice president Kamala Harris that Proclamation spurred a chant of approval from the crowd four years ago if someone had told you that you would be campaigning with Liz Cheney what would you have said to me period for the 21st century and as for the war between Russia and Ukraine what does success look like in ending the war in Ukraine
there will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine
and you and Charter participating in what that success looks like would you meet with President Vladimir Putin
to negotiate a solution to the war in UK
ew
must have a say in the future of Ukraine
as president would you support the effort to expand NATO to include U
those are all issues that
if and when it arrives at that point right now
we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression Donald Trump if he were president
Putin would be sitting in Keith right now
you know what that is it's about surrender
the hard left turn here but
you recently surprised
when you said that you are a
and then there's someone came into your house the first time I've talked about it so what kind of gun do you own and when and why did you get it
I have a
and I've had it for quite some time and I mean look up my background is in law enforcement
have you ever fired it yes
of course I have at a shooting range
yes of course I have

Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim walz was little known outside Minnesota just two months ago
he didn't exactly come from nowhere
governor of Minnesota
where he has championed abortion rights gun control and other Progressive
but it was calling former president Trump and Senator JD Vance weird
that may have landed him on the
2 months ago you and Kamala Harris barely knew each other
now you're running together vying for the top offices in the
it's not possible that you agree on everything
what have been some disagreements you've had since you became a team well
she probably disagreed with you said Tim you know you need to be a little more careful on how you say things whatever might
whatever it might be Wallace has been criticized for embellishing or telling outright falsehoods about his military record and about his travels to Asia in the 1980s
in your debate
JD Vance you said I'm a knucklehead at times
and I think you were referring to the time
that you said that you were in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square and rest when you were not
is that kind of misrepresentation
isn't that more than just being a Knuck
I think folks know who I am and I think they know the difference
between someone
getting a date Wrong by a rather than a pathological liar like Donald Trump but I think it comes down to the question of
whether you can be trusted to tell the truth yeah well I can't I think I can I will own up to being a knucklehead at times but the folks closest to me know that I keep my word
walls proudly touts his record as governor of Minnesota but it also has opened him up to criticism from his Republican opponents former president Trump says that you and your Administration here in Minnesota has been
dangerously Liber
radical left he call
so what do you say to that criticism that rather than leading the way
you and Minnesota are actually out of step with the rest of the country president Trump may be referring to that
that are children get breakfast and lunch in school so that they can learn he may be talking about we have a paid family medical leave policy that was promoted by the business community
Donald Trump spends his time tearing down States rather than lifting up the things we do the best of it Donald Trump's critiques of that
what what is his soul
it was that kind of humor in Candor that helped Lan Tim walz the job is Kamala Harris's running mate before you join the ticket you called Republicans weird
why do you think that label
that was really talking about the behaviors being obsessed with people's personal lives in their bedrooms and their reproductive right
making up stories about
legal folks legally here eating cats and dogs they're dehumanizing they go beyond weird because I said this it becomes almost dangerous let's debate policy in a real way and let's try and find an objective truth again Kamala Harris and Tim walz are in a full Sprint to November 5th
pooping their arguments will give them a chance to cross the line ahead of Donald Trump and JD Vance

with Donald Trump pulling out of his 60 Minutes interview tonight
will turn to a different Republican
who is paying the price for Trump's claims of a stolen 2020 election
Steven Richard
helps administer voting in Maricopa County Arizona
Maricopa is often decisive in a state which swings either way
Trump claimed Maricopa County was stolen in 2020
Republican Steven Richard was determined to find the truth
to restore belief in the
wasn't what many wanted to hear
I've become much more cynical about politics
there are a lot of people who have no lines in the sand a lot of politicians a lot of politicians for whom It's Like Oxygen that if you told them they were going to be re-elected it would be like unplugging them from oxygen
so whichever way the winds are blowing even if it's highly immoral or they're on they're on for the ride what are your fears for this coming election day
that will be doing this again for another 4 years
nearly four years ago Republican attorney Steven Richard was the voter's choice for Maricopa County Recorder the office that records voter registration and handles ballots by
Richard took office after the 2020 vote when his own party was up in arms over allegations of
it was Richard's first elected office
it's not that complicated of an issue it's just people are uncertain they expected Donald Trump to win I expected Donald Trump to win in Maricopa County he didn't win
they have questions as soon as we give them logical factual answers
all will be well and that's not what happened that does not happen
The Logical factual answers came after multiple investigations
a hand wreck
of Maricopa County's 2.1 million paper ballots confirmed
Joe Biden
Statewide prosecutions for illegal voting involved a total of 19 ballots in Maricopa
50 ballots had been counted twice for a typical reason somebody made a mistake a human being made a mistake there were 2.1 million ballots cast in the 2020 election these 50 shouldn't have been tabulated by no means where the 50 all for one candidate or another so it had a negligible impact on the actual contest
negligible to because Trump lost Maricopa County
by 45,109 votes what evidence of widespread fraud was found in Maricopa County in 2020
and I would say
Maricopa County 2020 election is the most scrutinized election in human history
when you begin to tell your fellow Republicans in Maricopa County
that the election was fair
and there was no fraud that would change the outcome
how did they react to you not
not well
they included Trump
who said
the entire database of Maricopa County in Arizona has been deleted
he called it an unbelievable election
who is this Saturday afternoon and I was in the office looking at the very thing that he was saying we had deleted and so just sort of like the the the the the ludicrous nature of it it just is is offensive what did you say in response to what the president I said something like
this is unh
I'm looking at the voter registration database right now
these lies have to stop this is as disprovable as saying 2 + 2 equals
and the reaction was
the reaction was significant
3 violent threats to Steven Richard have been prosecuted
one man got three and a half years the others are awaiting trial
what we see here is your public statement saying that this was not connected to the internet undaunted richer explained the facts here in 2021 he was heckled and followed to his car and people were banging on my windshield as I got into the car what were they shouting
turn
you're wrong you're an idiot
don't be a traitor
how could you
the fever
has never broken
this was 3 months ago so why do so many people remain passionately unconvinced
I think it has become the the the the the the the tattoo
I think it has become the tattoo to show that you're a True Believer of the movement
you believe the election
I do
Shelby Bush started a political action committee which investigates what she calls widespread fraud in Maricopa County
fraud no credible investigation has found
she's taken in nearly a million dollars in donations for the work of her pack Arizona and the Arizona Republican party awarded her the leadership of its delegation at last Summer's National Convention and that's why the delegation chair and our wonderful State Fair tickets
you are a rising star
well I definitely have brought some attention on to myself that is for sure
what do you believe happened in the Maricopa vote in 2020
I believe that fraudulent votes were put into the system I also believe that a lot of
State statutes and regulations and policies were
which makes the election questionable at best
Bush still questions whether signature verification was proper
and whether some ballots were collected illegally
choose an administrator in a medical practice
that's correct when it comes to elections
in a recent case a judge disqualified you from testifying in the case
because he said you were quote obviously unqualified not even in the ball
that's one judges opinion
who is a radical left
who is legislating from the bench and I don't believe that it had any Merit in my credibility whatsoever is there a danger
in undermining people's faith in the election system
by persist
with these conspiracy theories that no one has been able to Val
it has been validated and because the election the election officials
give me something
I don't need a government official with the vested interests and disproving information to tell me whether what I have is Val
it's up to each individual citizen as a member of this Society to review the evidence to think for themselves and make those decisions
they can determine whether it's valid the evidence speaks for itself data does not
data doesn't lie election officials do
the election was not stolen it was lost Attorney Ben Ginsberg has represented the Republican party in many of its most important election cases
in 2022 he joined conservative judges and senators in Lost not St
an investigation that exposes election fraud lies
part of it centers on Trump's swing state lawsuits
Donald Trump and his supporters brought 64 cases they lost 63 of them outright there was one that was a partial Victory involving 200 votes
how far from Malcolm to Terminator and all of that told you
the evidence to back up the allegations of Fraud and elections being unreliable simply does not exist the election deniers in Arizona will say we did lose all those cases but the judges weren't
under the rule of law you have every right to submit your litigation
but under the rule of law a conservative principle a republican principal for as long as I've been practicing election
you have to
the rulings of the
I don't have time frankly to worry about whether people believe me or question my Integrity I have what I believe is a mission that I am on and that mission is for my children and my grandchildren and I'm not here to make friends
I'm here to do a job where does that mandate for that mission come from
it comes from my own personal drive and it also comes from I believe a calling from God
in meetings of the republican-led Maricopa County Board of Supervisors which certifies the vote Dominion Michigan
have you been accused of treason
treason
murdering fellow officials that would talk
Republican Clint Hickman has been a County Supervisor 11 years in 2020 he was among Trump's most loyal supporters Maricopa County supervisor
Clint Hickman still proud that he took the time to call me out and thanked me for the work that I was trying to accomplish thank you
but Hickman saw no evidence of Fraud and said so when he voted to certify the election
you've received a number of death threats
I've lost cat I've lost
cancel off my colleagues and
solve election workers
well you've lost count but here's one
hello Mr Hickman I am glad that you standing up for democracy and want to place your hand in the Bible and say that the election was honest and fair I really appreciate that when we come to Lynch you're stupid lying comma ass you'll remember that you lied on the Bible
we're going to hang you
we're going to hang
that man is in prison for two and a half years
but there were other
but the chilling one that you didn't play is one of the guys said we know the restaurants
that you are in
we know where your kids go to school
Menace grew in the shadows
and emerged on the stage I hear the word unity and I get sick to my stomach
because there is a lot
of Earthly fake and vile Unity talk going around in our state this is Shelby Bush the Maricopa County Republican party Vice chair
talking about fellow Republican Steven Richard this past March so what is unity mean to me
men's unifying with those that share the core biblical Christian judeo principles that we share that's Unity but if Steven Richard walked in this room I don't unify with people who don't believe in the principles we believe in in the American cause that founded this country
when you heard Shelby Bush say that she would Lynch you you thought what if I first thought like why is that word in your vocabulary
weirdly historically loaded and oddly specific term
Bush offered a modified definition of lynching I think many people are familiar with a political lynching
add some it's referred to as
destroying someone's career it was not ever meant physically and any way shape or form probably a poor choice of words
you have seen
the unrest in this
the Civil disorder in this
you're contributing to that
what I am doing is I am shining a big bright
the disdain and the arrogance of some of the elected officials
they are elected to represent the interests of the people
and until they are ready to step up and do that then there will be unrest
is election denialism a swind
100 % so for some people it's a Swindle emotionally for some It's A Swindle politically for some It's A Swindle economically for
this past July Steven Richard ran in the primary for re-election
he lost to a fellow Republican who said Maricopa elections are a laughing stock richer moves on after this election leaving behind his enduring contribution The Fortress defenses around the center where the votes are counted a wall
to defend America
I have seen
some ugliness in in the character of human beings
it has given me great insight into horrific moments of human history
I would look at some of these historical moments that say
well dot dot dot I couldn't happen here
but the moments like these begin to give you insight
on how stuff like that can build up how the animal passions how going along with the crowd how the emotions of just being your side versus their
it's just to say that some of the same human impulses that I didn't understand I now do understand
you understand how things can go wrong
I understand how Society of educated people can do something truly horrible
