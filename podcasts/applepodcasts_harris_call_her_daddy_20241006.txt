hope and struggle a guilty verdict in the case that exposed deep cracks in America as more police shootings shocked the nation we are all a part of George Floyd's Legacy are things going to change Vice President Kamala Harris on the weight of responsibilities she feels next and he vote President Biden prepares to lay out his priorities to Congress infrastructure new taxes gun control the hard part starts now why don't you take the greatest need that we have and do it on something that we all agree on the man who holds the key to democratic priorities Senator Joe manchin joins me in moments plus future a group of moderate Senators say they're trying to find compromise is a deal possible Republican Senators selling more Capital joins me to discuss ahead
hello Dana Bash in Washington where the state of our Union is wondering just how much things have changed in the days since George Floyd's family and communities Across America celebrated the Derek Chauvin guilty ver
Venetian is spelled both hope that things are changing and despair over new police
now a bipartisan working group in Congress says there is momentum to make real progress on policing reform and effort that fail just last summer
and the White House says police reform will be a key part of President Biden's first address
to a joint session of Congress Wednesday night part of an ambitious agenda he hopes to pass with the slimmest majorities in the US Sen
as the nation waited to hear from
the Chauvin jury I spoke exclusively with vice president Kamala Harris about her history-making role the weight of the responsibility that brings and how and when President Biden seeks her add
9 minutes and 29 seconds right we
watch that video many of us watched in multiple times and
people are in pain over
we also in that video and
in fact it was in large part because of that case that together with my van colleagues Cory Booker in particular and then on the house side Karen bass that we wrote The George
Justice in policing act and
I really do hope that
the United States Senate the house is passed it that the United States Senate will take it on and have the courage to take it on because
there is no question
we've got to put an end to these moments
the public questions whether there's going to be accountability
questions whether there is going to be the kind of fairness that that we should all expect and deserve
in all of our lives and in particular as it relates to
people of color with a particular emphasis on
black and brown man in the criminal justice system as it relates to policing this verdict is but a piece of it
and it will not heal
the pain that existed for Generations that has existed for Jenner
among people who have experienced and firsthand Witness
what now a broader public is saying because of smartphones in the ubiquity of of our ability to videotape in real time what is happening in front of our faces
and that's just the reality
and that's why that's why Congress needs to
and that's why
they should pass
the George Floyd Justice in policing
racial tensions as you just mentioned they are really palpable your experience your life experience is different from every one of your predecessors how is that bringing itself to Bear right here in the White House
well I think that you know first of all
you'll recall that
when Joe Biden asked me to join him on the
he did so with a sense of intentionality of purpose
knowing that
can I may have very different life experiences but we also have the same values
but it was something that I know he was very intentional about in terms of asking me to run with him and to serve with him
which is that I will bring a perspective
that will contribute to
the overall decisions that we make he and I are in almost every meeting together
have made almost every decision together I'm not going to talk about our private conversations of course but I can tell you that it is often the case that as I will ask his opinion about things he will ask my opinion
and and through that process I think that we
we arrived at a good place and ultimately of course he is the president and he makes the final decision
do you feel a special responsibility
given the fact that I carry a
great weight of responsibility
knowing that there are so many people again
the generations of women
who fought for an imagined there would be a woman vice president or a woman on the
and I think of that all the time in terms of the responsibility I have
I carry a great sense of responsibility
for all of the young girls and boys of color those who identify in some way because maybe no one expected something of them but they expect a lot of themselves
to to do
and to do right and to do
so yes I carry a
great sense of responsibility if
of the seriousness of the responsibility
to be in this position and be a voice for those who have not traditionally been in the
but
in the United States Senate so you know you talked about the fact that you have a special responsibility the president talked about the fact that he would always have the backs of African-Americans in this country
so will you and he get more involved in the informal negotiations going on and if so
well we've made our position clear each of us and as an Administration we've made our position clear but it is for the folks in the Sin
to work together
to resolve whatever may be differences of opinion about the the details of the legislation
but I think there's no question that the American people
in a bipartisan
realize and and and and and and and and and want that there will be some reform of the system
there have been at least
mass shootings in America in a little over a
your Administration has made clear that infrastructure is the next big legislative priority why not guns Anthony fauci told me over the weekend that gun violence is a public health emergency
I would disagree we actually as an Administration have taken action the President issued executive orders for example on ghost guns
and and there is only so much however that a president can do through executive action
this President Joe Biden has a long-standing history
of speaking very clearly and unambiguously about the need for smart gun safety laws back from the time that he was in the Senate through today but I guess that emphasizes the point that both he and he was in the Senate when I was in the same thing we were pushing for legislation Congress has to act exactly because we have to codify that's a fancy word for make permanent make the law
that we agree we should have background checks that's just reasonable gun safety laws we should have an assault weapons ban assault weapons have been designed to kill a lot of people quickly
they are weapons of war and and Congress has to act Dana I mean
you know I was recently in Connecticut
Senators Murphy in Blumenthal and and the governor there so many people the families of Sandy
you're not honestly
I honestly thought
when those babies 26 and 7 year old children were slaughtered
and it didn't
welcome welcome
let me ask about immigration of course President Biden tasked you with leading diplomatic efforts to work with Mexico and the northern triangle countries to address the root causes of migration
how do you define success in this
that's a great question
well let's first talk about
what it is
you know I come at this issue from the perspective that most people don't want to leave home
they don't want to
the grandparents
they don't want to leave the place where they grew up where the you know they speak the language where they know the culture
the place where they're from the place what that is home most people don't want to leave home and when they do
they're fleeing some
or they cannot stay
and satisfy the basic necessities of life such as feeding their children and having a roof over their
that's the that that is part of a big part of what is going on
so I look at the issue of what's going on in the northern triangle from that perspective
and then my take on it is that we've got to understanding that
we have to give people some sense of
that if they stay
that help is on the way
and that brings me to then my focus which is
for example I convened a group of members of our cabinet secretary of agriculture Secretary of Commerce the head of the usaid which is our Aid organization Tony blinken secretary of state was a part of it Jake Sullivan was a part of it
and bringing together members of our cabinet to do what for example is going to happen out of Commerce which is they're going to convene a trade Mission virtually now and then the hope is in person later
with agriculture Tom bil
is going to increase our focus and our resources around helping the farmers in that region who have been devastated by crisis in terms of climate and and drought usaid ID were increasing our Disaster Response because again of the hurricanes
so this is the kind of work that has to happen the kind of work that has to happen is the Diplomatic work that we've been engaged in including my calls to the president of Mexico the president of Guatemala and and we have a plan to actually have another meeting coming up soon are you going to go there and that it is yes we're working on the plan to get there we have to deal with covid issues but
the piece about
Community Based organization so for example
this week in addition or next week in addition to meeting again with the president of Guatemala I will be meeting the following day with the community-based organizations in Guatemala they call them basically Civil Society
to figure out how we can better assist what they're doing on the ground
in a way again that they can give the resources to people who naturally want to stay at home
and give them some sense of
that help is on the way this is the work that we're doing but it's not going to be solved overnight it's a complex issue
listen if this were easy it would have been handled years ago but that's what I was going to ask you when President Biden said
just as he was asked to do it
Joe Biden's vice president had it was asked by President Obama
to focus on the Northern triangle and he has asked me to do and to carry on
the work that that he did and you know you get back get back to the question that you've asked
we're making progress
but it's not going to evidence itself over
it will
but it will be worth it and I will tell you part of my approach to this is we've got
institutionalized the work and also internationalize it which is why for example I'm working with Ambassador Thomas Greenfield
we're making of our allies in the United Nations
because again this this is about the Western Hemisphere
we are a neighbor in the Western Hemisphere
and it is also about understanding that we have the capacity to actually get in there if we are consistent part of the problem is that under the previous administration they pulled out
essentially a lot of what had been the Continuum of work and it essentially
our team
that this has to be a function of a of a of a priority that is an American priority
and not just a function of whoever happens to be sitting in this chair because for example looking at again the route
extreme weather conditions has had a huge impact on one of their biggest industries which is agriculture including drought right and so a residual Point not only is about the economic Devastation and what we need to do to assist with economic development and relief
parents and if children cannot literally eat
if they cannot have the basic essential things that everyone needs to live of course they're going to flee and that's what we're saying President Biden always said that he wants you to be the last person in the room particularly for a big decisions just as he was for President Obama he just made a really big decision Afghanistan yes
read the last person in the room
and you feel comfortable I
this is a president
who has an extraordinary amount of
he is someone
who I have seen over and over again
make decisions
based on what he truly believes based on his years of doing this work and studying these issues
what he truly believes is the right thing to do
and I'm going to tell you something about him
he is acutely aware that it may not be politically
are advantageous for him personally
it's really something
and I and I wish that the American public could see sometimes what I see
because ultimately and the decision always rests with him
but I have seen him over and over again make decisions
basically on what he believes is
regardless of what may be the political people tell him is in his
we're almost at 100 days
tell me something that has surprised you that you never thought
personally as the vice president of the United States we are going to
half of America's children out of poverty
how about that
how about that
think about that
how much
that means
what what that will mean
that's good stuff
that's really good stuff
thank you for your time I appreciate it thank you thank you
and coming up it is now more than 60 mass shooting in just 6 weeks in America is there finally momentum in Congress to act Senator Joe manchin is here next welcome back to State of the Union on Pandora and exhausted by a string of Massachusetts
Biden's big sale to rebuild and reinvent the nation's infrastructure
joining me now for an exclusive interview is the man who holds the key in the Senate to whether any of that can get done Democratic senator Joe manchin of West Virginia thank you so much for coming in nice to see you in person so you said this week the best chance for bipartisan infrastructure is to focus on what you call conventional infrastructure Rhodes Bridges water broadband
a key Republicans introduced a proposal 600 billion targeted to the issues you're talking about do you support it that's a good start it really is and I'm glad they did it because it came out of BPW committee which is Tom Carpenter
am I calling Shelley capito is basically the ranking member and they've worked it together so we know it has bipartisan support we just have to look to see if we've gotten everything in there that we need and we'll be working on that together so I'm very very pleased with that and this is the way we start negotiations
they put their best foot forward but it's a starting point
you say that and clearly there is a lot of work to do but I want to ask kind of more of a big picture cuz there seems to be a bit of a disconnect
on how to Define infrastructure here
President Biden has brought her ambition
he for example has a plan inside his his big proposal
that includes 400 billion dollars for
in-home care for elderly Americans and those with disabilities also billions more for child care
to what extent we have to go in that and go through the process of having our hearings
I'm looking at a markup in a committee and then seeing having professionals come
going to the floor with an amendment process by that time you're going to have all different sides coming to agree hopefully to agree on something just take what we just did last
which was the hate crimes
who would have thought we'd have gotten 94
think about that people wouldn't have expected
Democrats Republicans to be in unison
when you talk about infrastructure they understand infrastructure internet is a new infrastructure that we didn't have before and it should be but you're talking about Transit airports rail systems the the lines as far as our electricity which is the grid system all of these things need upgraded we have to make sure the new energy coming on they were able to get it to Market
so all of this has to be incorporated that's infrastructure what we would call traditional infrastructure the human infrastructure is something that we're very much concerned about
and when you think about all that we have done in the last year
and plus the covid bill this year
American Rescue plan an awful lot has been done there too so we have to see what the effects of all that is so it just to be clear it sounds like you're supporting a smaller package with what you deem traditional immortality and would you tackle everything else with
51
Brew the reconciliation process
if people would just think about
if we go through the process that we're supposed to we never used to use
filibuster and Reconciliation is only used for budget
that's why you have the guard rails put on with the bird roll so we have to get back
to getting it into the Committees let the committee chair and the members of those committees work at the jurisdictions whichever comes to I'm chairman of energy energy projects would come to me then we will work it give it back to the majority leader they put it on the floor with an open amendment process that's true Maine once you go through all of that
Friday night Saturday until we got it that was a long time ago President Biden is going to give his first speech to Congress this week he's going to call for higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans
in order to combat poverty and expand child
1 and 5 children in your home state of West Virginia live in poverty so do you think that raising taxes
to help those who need
I think we can find a balance but when you have reports from professionals that say that
billion to 1 trillion dollars not even collected in the loopholes we had we eviscerated the IRS they don't have the guts or basically the the Firepower they had before all of this thing should be explored before we start just raising taxes exponentially so you don't support raising taxes at all right now oh yeah I always support basically I'm I'm supporting anything that makes common sense in this reasonable
scope of the program of how much they want and see if that's necessary or needed I guess my question is if there's somebody out there wondering if their taxes are going to if they're worth
have you been paying your taxes at all
have you been able to use different pass-throughs and different bypasses or loopholes have been in the system we're going to close all those we have to
Senator I talked to Democrat
who tell me
the reason President Biden's ambitious agenda is so big and so bold is because they understand history
and history shows that the president's party if they have majorities in Congress as he does oftentimes lose that in the midterm election
that's why they have a small window to get things done they believe it's possible so they believe that you're one of the main roadblocks on getting those goals accomplished how do you respond to them the best politics is good government I can't believe that people believe
that if you just do it my way and that will give us some momentum to get through the next election
but when you do something that everyone
tags on to and I've seen good things happen that people voted against it took credit for when he went back home
we won't give this system a chance to work I'm not going to be part of blowing up
this democracy of ours or the Republic that we have
if we have a 51 boat threshold in the Senate the same as the
the house wasn't designed to be partisan the house was designed to be hot as a fire
we were designed to cool
and that's the founding fathers it
brilliant brilliant strategy they looked at so why can't we try
to make this work if you have the violent swings every time you have a party
then we will have no consistency whatsoever I want to ask you about the issue of
you're talking a lot about bipartisanship you have had a bipartisan plan to expand background checks for some years
we have seen I talked to the vice president earlier in the week I said it was 50 mass shootings in 6 weeks now it's up to
more than 90% of Americans support Universal background checks so where is the urgency on this shouldn't this be a really important key priority for you as somebody who wants to work every time
we've basically took a bill way back in 2013 myself and Pat to
and we worked on it had goodbye goodbye partisans support then we lost it right in the last week and I was against
common gun sense
and now we have a group working together you've got Chris Murphy doing a great job Chris is looking for that balance you have to understand
strangers but we have so many loopholes in the system
can't we just fix what's broken but a lot of people are asking that we do but then we get a bill that has everything but that
it has that and a lot more
the common sense approach to fixing the things that are broken and then move from there
Republican senator Lisa murkowski I know she's your friend but you disagree on a whole lot of things
from the GOP tax cut Bill to the individual mandate which she voted to repeal Amy Coney Barrett why'd you
such as Lisa murkowski the the solid I'm not say solid looks at the issue not afraid to make and step out and make a decision she's done that and done it so well over many many years her and I have been friends and we've had great convers
strenuous thought process
and I think people like Lisa murkowski should be in the
and I'm going to support the people that I do I don't look at the party line saying that's a barrier for me
the country is what my concern is and having the best people to make decisions there's so much we can do together you can't throw
you just can't throw out
the purpose of us being in the Senate there's two senators for every
little Delaware little Rhode Island big California Big Texas big New York
the minority always has input and it has to stay that way
Senator Joe manchin thank you so much for your time I appreciate it thank you for having thanks for coming in
and the last two term Republican president slams his party and what is to become under Donald Trump so do moderate Republicans still support president Trump Senator Shelley Moore capito joins me next
welcome back to State of the Union I'm Dana Bash some Senate Republicans are countering President Joe Biden's 2 trillion dollar plus infrastructure plan with one of their
a sliver of the size clothes to 600 billion dollars focusing primarily on Transportation like roads and bridges with other areas like broadband internet and drinking water they're calling it a starting point
joining me now is a republican leading the effort on the counter offer Senator Shelley Moore capito of West Virginia thank you so much for joining me this morning Senator you unveiled your own 600 billion infrastructure Bill and number you called a good starting point but President Biden is pushing for a 2.3 trillion dollar bill so if this is all about bipartisan compromise are you willing to go over a trillion dollars to meet Democrats in the middle
well I think we have to look at the comparison of the two plans we really narrowed the focus on infrastructure to really look at physical infrastructure roads Bridges rail airports Water Systems the president's bill of 2.2 trillion goes you know far afield from that so where I think the first starting point we need to have is Let's do an Apples to Apples comparison of the physical infrastructure core infrastructure part of his plan the president we thought it was really important to show what we thought was important what's going to be the job creating infrastructure and how much it would be so I think we're at a really and all indications are it's time to really start putting the pencils to the paper
so just to follow up on that if the Apples to Apples match and and you come to an agreement you are open to
Midway point just on the money
as long as it's paid for as long as we've always done this bipartisan this physical infrastructure piece and there's no reason we shouldn't be able to get to an agreed amount at this point I don't know where that is right now but at least we're talking we're starting to talk and we've gotten some good signals back that this is the direction the White House and others want to go you've said that infrastructure should be fully paid for
but you also say increasing the corporate tax rate is a non-negotiable red line so would any tax hike be acceptable to you
yes I have yes I have a very encouraging signs I saw what the Jen psaki said on her and her comments and I've talked with others
and we are circling back on Monday to
this is an active conversation and and I think that it's a good beginning
you said that you expect climate change to be part of these infrastructure negotiations you're a republican who believes the climate crisis is real and you say that you want to be part of the solution President Biden is proposing 174 billion dollars for electric cars and his plan are you open to that
does have infrastructure in there for electric charging stations and Innovations around electric vehicles where I differ from the president is I don't think we need $160 to buy electric vehicles I don't think that we should be building the charging stations throughout this country when private
private entities are going to be the beneficiaries of having charging stations at their different stopping points along the highways and I think they should play A Part here so I think that's where we really start to really separate on TVs I'm all about
moving forward with the technology and creating an electric vehicle economy that's fine but let's let the private sector participate in that that's where I think has the best
I want to turn to the issue of police reform your fellow Republican senator Tim Scott proposed a compromise on so-called qualified immunity that would allow individuals to sue police departments but not individual police officers
do you support that
Scott's efforts I was on the Justice act that got caught up in politics in the in the fall I think he is redoubled his efforts and is working across the aisle I think the time is now I think there's a real a real
the possibilities of having what is a core I think function of our of our government which is a law enforcement that protects us a qualified immunity is it is a definitely a hot button issue I think the way that Senator Scott has formulated some revisions qualified immunity is is on the table right now I know he's an active negotiations on this piece and I know that's a big piece of this
and do you like what you heard about it
eliminates choke holds it it makes a registry so that you're not passing bad cop bad cop I mean there's a lot of really good things in there that I think are going to be the core of any kind of Justice bill that we passed I know there's different ideas there's the George Floyd and others so we'll be looking at that to try to find ways to move forward
I want to ask about vaccine hesitancy senator Paul show almost half of Republicans don't want to get a vaccine
I want you to listen to your fellow Republican Senator Ron Johnson and what he said about getting vaccin
Yuba vaccine
what do you care if your neighbor has one or not
what is it to you you got a vaccine and you know science is telling you it's very very effective
so why is this big push to make sure everybody gets a vaccine
he went on to say he's quote highly suspicious
What's Happening Here do comments like that hurt your push for Americans to get vaccinated especially hesitant Republic
I believe that we should all have confidence that we should to not just protect ourselves but our communities and our neighbors we should get vaccinated and and I wouldn't say that only Republicans have hesitancy I think that there are some folks that are unsure and you know when we saw what happened over the last week with the Johnson & Johnson
and that's what we need to take into consideration
speaking of fellow Republicans another one at Liz Cheney was Under Fire you remember for voting to impeach president Trump there's a New York Times report that some of her male GOP colleagues made with some women in the room considered sexist attacks when compared it to when you quote look up into the stands and see your girlfriend on the opposition's side
as a republican woman yourself when you heard about that what did you
Liz Cheney is one strong woman and I think she has a terrific
inside and great strong backbone so I don't think anything any comment like that could even touch her in terms of offending her I mean people have to just
stop with the Casual comments that are hurting that they don't realize the ramifications of it I don't know I mean I feel like as a woman leader I'm going to be just as strong as a man and whatever whatever the side comments are I just don't pay attention to him we just got to keep moving forward here
last question you called president Trump's actions during the January 6th Insurrection disgraceful and you said history will judge him harshly would you support the former president if he runs again in 2024
still is very Vivid in in many of us who were at the Capitol that day in our minds as a as a very sad day for our country the Republican party is strong we got a lot of folks who are not just looking to lead in 2022 but into 2024 so we'll see I hope that President Trump plays a role I don't know whether he'll run or not but you know we can sort that out as time goes on thank you
okay Senator Shelley Moore capito Republican of West Virginia appreciate it
all right thank you and when we come back some welcome good news to report
some good news to share now all of us here at State of the Union want to welcome its newest member of the CNN family Oliver Sterling azaman born this week to our executive producer Abigail and her husband Alex Oliver and his mom are both doing great and ready for Oliver to get to know his big brother n
