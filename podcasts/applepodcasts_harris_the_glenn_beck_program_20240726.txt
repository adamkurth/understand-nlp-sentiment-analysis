exhale hey Google we talked about the president having to prove that it was actually a bullet and not a shrapnel or glass from the glass ceiling that Kamala Harris is just broken we talked to the Trump campaign about the Secret Service and and so much more on that also we we had a surprise call from Kamala Harris this is a show you do not want to miss it's the Friday podcast the begins now first let me tell you about real estate agents time for you to sell your house are you ready are you going to need to do all sorts of things get it all done you know to the place you have to know the best Carpenter to call the best carpet guy the best plumber somebody who knows something maybe in moving dirt since you got some erosion there in the backyard that's going to have to be addressed do you know somebody that can take care of all this quickly and inexpensively well that's what a great real estate agent can do when you go with real estate agents I trust you're going to be working with an agent who's one of the best in the business people who sometimes literally work around the clock to get you into a home game this is my company and it's just a referral company but don't take my word for it do your own homework contact real estate agents I trust.com you will see the difference real estate agents I trust.com
and I think part of that is because my theory is
Biden endorsed Kamala to box everybody
when he resigned he came out almost immediately after he was like I'm endorsing now
and
that was that started the ball rolling for cim
Barack Obama didn't indoors
and he waited and he waited and he waited and the Rumor was he doesn't like Kamala and also doesn't think
she'd
so he was holding back on his endorsement and of course the media was telling us she's just raised 870 trillion dollars in the last 2 hours said she's announced
and and so everybody got on the Kamala train again except for Michelle Obama
and then
yesterday
Kamala was coming off of a
and her phone rang and thank goodness DNC cameras were there to catch
are these people
capable of doing anything in a genuine fashion
I love the point is at some point they kind of take the angle from her I guess from kind of her right facing and you can see the the face of the phone
and she's got speaker on it's like well what place up to her ear but she's got speaker phone on of what person answers the phone like that and people don't do that you either put it up to your or you put on speaker she's doing both
if you had the president of the United States a former president of the United States calling if Donald Trump
calls me
do I have it on speaker
no not at all you don't know what it's about you want to make sure it could be something important that maybe everybody in the room in the camera shouldn't hear RFK JR could learn this lesson Perhaps it is one of those things that you now obviously this was completely staged obviously the cameras were there for a reason wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
Sound Stage or you just
are you just saying that it was probably
just everything I know about human activity and interaction makes me believe that this was staged as almost all comma Harris Communications are this
end authentic that's what you're saying incredibly and authentic yes but and this is going to be an issue for Kamala she runs for president at the top of the ticket instead of on the bottom of it
well I I don't know what you're talking about because I think people love her
because she is so genuine well as you pointed out she's she's not ready 110 trillion dollars and what was it 2 1/2 hours so
that's impressive a lot
a lot of hype around comma right now and this is what you're going to get right Glenn for the next 3 months what kind of media coverage shall we be expecting over the next 3 months would you say
well I would say until she gets to the
until she gets the official
as you know the the the the voters have
you know already because they elected delegates and the delegates were assigned to Joe Biden but the people have spoken this is democracy in action I've never seen anything like it these people just love democracy
alright well if I may quote the president from his speech the other night
democracy is
and and who doesn't love Monocacy
so in democracy has happened I don't know did you see Chuck Schumer's statement when he was
when he was proud to announce that she's the Canada officially I didn't I missed this one how was it was very very very
we played it yesterday
oh no it is so good stew it's not just
inau
it's full of so much bull crap
you can't even imagine listen so now that the process is played out from the Grassroots bottom up we are here today to throw our support behind vice president Kamala Harris I'm clapping you don't have to
oh my God that was about oh my God so he and he's cheering like a little kid like Yay it's like he's trying to cheer on a 3033 in the Democratic party is like
call Joe you answered all the questions about yellow school buses say there's a reason for that because the only people left in their party must be idiots that's why you have to speak to them like that none of them can understand anything other than sing song in nonsense that you targeted toddlers
I love the fact that in that species
now that the process is played
from the Grassroots to the top
when were the
when did the people get involved in this at all they voted for the police in the process now that the process is played out we asked the delegates to change their vote
and the superdelegates are now on board we can say I mean they literally voted for the person comma was able to cool out of the nomination what do you mean the process and that was I don't know if you went through this reporting on the reporting behind the scenes on Barack and Schumer and Pelosi
I don't know if I believe this but that they were basically holding back
to make it look like a process they wanted it to look like these delegates came to these conclusions on their own and then they would come out indoors and endorse that was the reason they didn't do it I don't know that the wording of that Barack Obama announcement
you had me shudder
I will say after I read it because I was like oh my gosh they are going to come up with a quote unquote process that puts Michelle right in there and I'm losing this bed aren't
multiple days of panic went off to the insane asylum for just a few days and and now I'm back here after that very convincing endorsement by Michelle
yeah do you notice you notice she
she doesn't say
I'm so excited that you're going to be
she said I'm excited
cuz you know this is going to be histor
well yeah a lot of things that the shooting of Donald Trump was historic as well
I just didn't gather the
real sincere
we're not plotting your death
I mean in some sense Glenn all events that occur eventually become historic and in that sense
yes yes yes it will be able to happen in history and that that will be something we can all remember and look back on they were one step away in that phone call from saying you know
Kamala we just read in the New York Times that
peace on you about how
you love to cook
and you ought to come up you ought to come up to the vineyard and cook for us and then maybe go for a swim with Barack
cuz we don't really have a chef anymore and maybe you could and just you know stay the weekend
I mean I don't know it's funny it's because like they're the the political toppling of of
of everything I mean they did this to Joe Biden they politically it was attended his his 50 years of Public Service in a
everyone's like oh well we're happy she's up by a point and a half in the polls
like what what party is this the party that demanded
pair so much about democracy
does a force all of his primary opponents off the primary ballot they canceled multiple primaries they reorganized the primaries to to make sure the ones that Joe Biden could win came first
RFK Jr basically out of the party they didn't give him Secret Service protection they wouldn't increase the Secret Service protection for a Donald Trump that wound up in an assassination attempt that's after they tried to kick him off of the ballots and after they tried to throw him in prison and after they tried to get all third-party candidates kicked off the ballots and swing States all over the country and then after they had the best primary the guy who wanted they threw out of the nomination and just installed someone this is the party of democracy
no more Christmas music or anything else and it was definitely not Barack and Michelle and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer putting a gun to my head

I'm not president Trump I wasn't just shot and that has got to change people
so we're looking to see what he's going to decide and and how he's handling things including
Christopher Wray coming up and testifying in front of Congress and saying you know we're not sure he was actually shot we're not sure that was a bullet of it might have been glass I guess
commas glass ceiling that she broke or you know maybe maybe it was shrapnel no
read the New York Times
it was a bullet
it is so insane how these conspiracy theories come from the left and they just expand and expand and expand on them
Carolyn Sunshine is with us she's the 2024 Deputy communications director for Donald Trump
first of all Carolyn how are you the staff and the president
well we are always better than Joe Biden outside the hours of 10 and 4:00 p.m. I can tell you that always but I guess it looks like the Democratic party is trying to become unburdened by what has been and have Joseph down and put the selected but not Alexa
but you can hear I'm in a good spirits and laughing because I have the honor of working for president Donald J Trump who is a man who after you know mere seconds after an Assassin's bullet and it was a bullet Glenn as you just said came within a millimeter of his life this man got to his feet and then fight fight fight fight fight and then went on to have a phenomenal week in Milwaukee unifying a complete Republican party behind him you just saw some clips released from the great phenomenal golfer Brian I think getting to see some of President Trump's side so everybody is in very High Spirits
president Trump is I called the Great American warrior because I think Ronald Reagan was the great communicator and other US president a great US president who had a brush with the Assassin's bullet but president Trump's the Great American warrior and as he said you know I'm going to talk about this one so I'm going to share it share it with Candace he did on the stage in Milwaukee and then I'm going to move on and I'm going to get back to work and that's exactly what he's done and it's really inspiring
to work for somebody such a remarkable leader there's just a few like
so everybody that I talk to
that at all like Donald Trump or thought that you know I I'm thinking about it for
everybody that I know I talked to they saw him in the convention they said he is a changed man he's a different man
and and not
just a guess in his seriousness
the gravitas of
did the bullet change him
I've been asked this question a lot going on it's a great question I've been asking a lot I think the bullet that grazed him may have changed the country more and the reason I say that is because I think when that bullet came within a millimeter of President Trump's life
you know if president Trump isn't in this Arena who is there to actually fight for a secure border and an economy where I mean people can actually have a chance that the American dream let alone be able to go to the grocery store and you know you buy three items and all of a sudden you go how is this right like it's not it is and then more generally I think for the Forgotten men and women of this country who who prior to president Trump's arrival on the political scene really had no authentic champion and certainly not one of the caliber of Donald J Trump so I think that is really what you think it was a watershed moment for the country I think it's one of those moments where everyone's going to look back and they're going to remember where they were standing and who they were with when it happened but I also look at it as I said the only thing more remarkable than what president Trump survived is the his reaction who has that reaction within seconds of having a bullet come within a millimeter of your life and present danger and you got up and you say fight fight fight fight and I do think that
president Trump is now in this unique category of people who I'm sure you've known people like this too
who have had a brush with
there is a unique category of people who have come right to that edge of the thing that I think most of us fear deep down in a way which is death that this ride ends we believe in a life after this one but that's the scary thing and you watch this man come within a millimeter of his life come face-to-face with death within seconds back on his feet and also back to work and I have a lot of reverence for the men and women in our military and our veterans and like the long history in our country of when you look at the stories of Honor recipients past and present you know you just see the fight of an act like that
and I just think that this country so deserving of somebody like President Trump
how to brush with the Assassin's bullet like you said he's the man who took a bullet for democracy and then 10 days later this man doesn't need to go Retreat to Camp David for a week or take a nap for 2 years or whatever it is this man is like I'm ready to get back to work for you you know
Carolyn so is he going to listen to the Secret Service
the Secret Service of leadership in Washington DC and you know the rank and file secret service agent who
do a phenomenal job protecting president Trump who gives their who are quite willing to give their lives for president Trump as you as you saw in Pennsylvania
I would say this it's the job of the Secret Service to protect president Trump whether a rally is inside or outside and president Trump in the past has held many rallies that are indoor arena as he told many rings are Outdoors he just goes where where the people go so we you know we want these investigations to play out at the DC level because of course the American people deserve answers we don't have time to be wasting hearing Christopher Wray go through the semantics it was an assassination attempt on a Ford he's been examined by a steamed physician Ronnie Jackson great physician was the president president Trump's position
during his time in the white house excellent position he examined him you've seen the reports this is very I don't know why we're wasting time on that when by the way it wasn't just
in Assassin's bullet that grazed president Trump Corey come for a tour is dead his wife is left without a husband his children are left without a father we had multiple people injured and what wasting time on shrapnel versus bullet and Glenn I got to tell you this is I can't believe I'm going to say
this is the first time in a long time I heard AOC asked a question more intelligent and Christopher Wray when she asked the question hey you know if you know that the standard AR-15 has a range of you know 500 yd
why isn't that factored into your perimeter calculations like I was shocked like there's the first time there's bipartisan consensus in Washington DC for the first time in a long time as there should be but anyways like I said president Trump he just gets right back to work and he's going to be headed back on her he's headed to Minnesota he's going to be headed to Pennsylvania he's he's back on the road you know it's sort of a rain or shine indoor or outdoor
I'm very grateful and confident for the men and women who served president Trump in the Secret Service and as president Trump has said
he's getting back to work and so are the people because it's the other thing going to write is like nobody should be afraid to attend a peaceful political rally in the United States of America nobody should be afraid to do that nobody should be afraid to lose their life at a peaceful political rally and I know you've seen our rallies are extraordinary there's just something special about them there's something special about the energy or something special about thousands of people who love our country coming together in one place and I think again what was remarkable about President Trump's reaction if you remember watching that day back
when it happens in the first moments the crowd understandably terrified ducking afraid that is a normal human reaction to have but the second president Trump gets back to his feet and says fight fight fight fight fight within 5 Seconds of that bullet grazing you know coming within a millimeter of his life that crowd was calm and he actually president Trump save lives that day
I I will tell you that
when I watched it I saw it live and when
when he went down
I mean a lump went to my throat immediately and cuz I knew what was was happening
and I thought oh my God they had they've hit the president
and I had that lump in my throat and when he stood up and I could hear him say wait wait
and he stood up and then he looked over the shoulder of one of the agents and puts his arm
I was crying for an entirely different reason
that fast it turned around in me and I went from
horror and shock to immense pride and admiration it was it was remarkable
tell me
how is he going to
switch gears with Kamala I'm sure he's not concerned about it and does he believe that she's actually going to be the Nomine
well as I said you know you watch the Democrat Party trying to become unburdened by what has been and thinking that if they just do a little Switcheroo here you know having Joe step down and putting comma at the top of the ticket that that somehow changes things but it doesn't because Joe Biden's record is Kamala Harris's record and it's a democratic party's record look at her first few speeches what is she saying
how much she loves Joe's been so great I mean she's owning this full force and I expect her to nobody has had more of a front row seat to both Joe Biden's cognitive decline and concealing that from the American people than her comma Harris but then look at her own words when she said she was the last person in the room when Joe Biden was executing his invisible withdrawal of Afghanistan that resulted in the lives of 13 US service members losing their lives and of course couldn't remember the last person in the room for many of those decisions but here's the thing
as much as Joe Biden's record is Kamala Harris's record she's also dangerously liberal you know that she comes from the sales State of California
this is a woman who has given the chance would turn this country into California she is the borders are who's never been to the Border we heard those reports you just seen right of her current border patrol Chief and former border patrol Chief both
yeah we never got a phone call from her you know she's never called no she's never called okay well you know what's happened since she's never called we've had almost 20 million maybe more illegal immigrants come across our Southern border we've had 30 tons of fentanyl about 360 watch list come across our Southern border on her watch that's enough by the way to kill every American citizen multiple times over she was just in here she's not changing she was just in Houston yesterday that is a 1 hour flight 1 hour commercial flight from the US border 45
then go and that's not because of incompetence that's because of negligence she doesn't want to secure the Border if we don't have a border we don't have a country she doesn't want to secure the Border she wants to defund
themes of slavery with cheese this is not a woman who cares about Law and Order it's actually part of her worldview she's far more left than Joe Biden on a lot of issues she's dangerously liberal she really more closely resembles Barack Obama then Joe Biden in many ways in terms of policy and will
Caroline Sunshine thank you so much and my best to everybody on the team we've been praying not only for the president his family but also everybody on the team stay safe thank you Caroline thank you this is the best of the Glenn Beck program Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris on with us now
vice president Harris
hi Glenny
how are you
you know I'm good I'm just on the campaign Trail you know we're hitting the road
taking over one city at a time okay
so so is I mean is it official now are you the
the candidate I know you just got an endorsement from Michelle and and
yeah well they didn't really have a choice now did they
but yes I am the official candidate as far as I'm concerned
as far as you're concerned because the Democratic Party
yeah it I mean it did this is a kind of a new thing where you don't have the vote you know Chuck Schumer called a Grassroots but
it doesn't seem like the typical you know democracy kind of
well you know we sat down and you know at a big table you know right next to Nancy's cauldron and we all decided you know we have to just make sure that Donald Trump doesn't get elected and we're going to do everything we can to stop it from happening and it doesn't matter the law doesn't matter at this point
that's the bottom line here
and we're going to do everything we can tell the people will think of at the end of the day democracy Morocco
so are you planning on debating president Trump then
I was a little nervous at first right but you know it looks like he's backing out now
and hopefully he's not trying to you know pull a quick one but
I think I'm ready I think I'm ready to unburden what has been
can you tell me exactly what that means cuz you say that a lot
and you seem to love it a lot why is that such an important phrase to you
Brooklyn you know we all just watch
and the television coverage
I'm just yesterday
of what we can see and what we can be
and really it's just about opening up your hor
I'm trying to unburden what has been now I've discovered
that I've gotten all the way here by just saying nonsense you know it has to mean something it doesn't matter if I don't know what it means but as long as you know the American public
can sit there and ponder it long enough
but I'll get into that seat before they figure it out
I crack myself up you know I can't help it I know you're you're very funny you're very very funny so have you made a decision on the VP pick because stew and I both think it's going to be the Astron
yeah I was told that that's not going to completely be up to me so like I said you know Nancy she's working hard over here with her cauldron behind the
alright okay so you can't answer can you can't answer that
I saw the story in the New York Times that was very hard hitting on you saying that you're probably the the
the the one candidate in the history of the United States that really knows her way around a kitchen
get well that can be true
did you find that a little insulting I mean I
I mean it's kind of like you know keep them barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen isn't it
you know I'll give you my best recipe Glenn and then you're going to understand why everyone Braves about my cooking first of all I want to the black voters and they love a woman in the kitchen right so let's look for example when I'm doing my turkey and I love giving out this recipe all right you take a little black pepper it's the simplest recipe but somehow yeah I make it sound like it's the most difficult thing in the world you take a little black pepper a little time
you know I'm definitely you can't forget the kosher salt and that's why we need the Jews we need the juice and you know put a little salt a little pepper and you get right under that cavity and voila it's like I invented cooking
that doesn't really sound like even a recipe
you know I'm doing the best I can hear Glenn whose side are you on okay okay okay all right one last thought I saw that Charlie XCX
yes is a Performing Artist
you have put a banner on your page
that says Kamala HQ with a neon background and lowercase letters
and that looks just like Charli XCX is album brat
is that is
is that something that you are trying to
image yourself as
well here's the thing Glen at some point I called the young voters stupid because let's face it that's what they are right and you know I'm just trying to rework that image to my benefits so you know I'm just trying to be happening and you know depending on what demographic I can do to
in this case and I have to Pander to the young voters you know Brett it is
and you know it just depends on who I'm trying to
I'm trying to trick at this point you know what I mean okay all right yeah sure let me introduce you to stay balti she you've seen her on YouTube
I have to tell you yesterday
your YouTube videos you are doing you look like her
you sound like her her laugh is exactly like this
how did you come across I mean when did you realize
oh my gosh I could do this voice
I was actually just you know playing around I told this already so you know so many outlets but I was really playing around during the pandemic I had downloaded tiktok I started doing some lip syncing you know just goofing around and somebody had told me you know when you when you listen really close you can sound you know you kind of sound like
now at that time you know I just attempted the impersonation I don't think it was that good at that time I think I
later on
is actually merging with hers so I think that that's kind of like a you know the a working hazard
but yeah it just took some time and after a couple of years I think I really got it down
so you you watch her a lot
what is your
what are your thoughts about
I don't know her intelligence level what is what's the deal with her
it's very easy for me in that sense that's why it's easy for me to mimic her and to create like this sarcastic satire because I find her very ingenuine in general I think comedians are Impressionists do they have this thing where they have to watch people and be observant
so inauthentic
you know down to the left and intelligence wise you know I'll tell you something just from a woman's perspective forget about conservative liberal any of that from a woman's perspective
I will be completely honest with you just it makes me angry that someone like that can be in power and is making women look bad across the board because
I think that's what people find the refreshing about my content is that I'm pretty much like it directs in your face
and I don't find her intelligent at all
despite the fact that she was just her attorney and
you know her her track record speaks for itself look what you did in the Bay Area look what she did with
you know the population of the black man that she had the fact that they can do this and she comes out on a stage and gas lights over and over again and specifically I want to say the word gas
because everything she says is completely untrue with the exact opposite and they project a lot in their campaign and
and you know at this point I'm not sure where this road will lead me but right now I'm being
I'm just being true to myself and I really want to just expose her as much as I can and I think comedy is the best way to do that
I agree with you I agree with you and you're very good at it you don't know where it's leading you well if if they win it may be jail
throw that out there
I could see what's happening here and it's just really sad like she's a Democratic Socialist I don't understand how people don't see it
you know money isn't everything I really rather we get our country back
yeah I agree
well thank you so much and you just you have to give me one more
Kamala laugh for could you do something with a yellow school buses that you just love so much
I just love them you know they're so great and the wheels turn on those yellow school buses and you know I haven't been diagram about it you're right on my wall and on one side there's Lily on one side there's a yellow and it's just great Willie's the driver right and I love that joke you know and I don't understand the obsession that I've developed or when I developed a succession but you know right thank you so much
