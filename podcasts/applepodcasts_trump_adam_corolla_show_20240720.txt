hello Adam hello Donald Trump
promise I'm having a hard time signing that many books I don't know if you heard what happened but the sign that many you know
I have to sign the books and it's it's brutal for me to sign you know I think we did 8 or 9000 books in one sitting last time
the book by the way let me get the book out crippled America how to make them how to make America great again the fact that I live in Hollywood of course that how to make America great again is scoffed at by a lot of folks who live in my town like it's sad that we think of that is sad something that should be Noble
it's actually should be positive not negative but anyway do you know what are you doing are you doing a podcast or something yeah we're doing a podcast and we're recording you and we'll go ahead right thank you we're rolling rolling right now I had dinner with him last night after right after he did the show with you so he was a great guy
and I'm a ratings machine Adams so I know this is a favor to you because you've been great so let's get going because I do it right now okay the book crippled America how to make America great again so excited that you called and appreciate you making the time I wanted to ask a couple things
I was listening to your book I've heard about 3/4 of it I got the discs and I've been listening to him in my car as a matter of fact going out to meet Jimmy last night for dinner I listen to the first half of the book because of LA traffic
it all makes sense to me why doesn't it make sense the more Americans and why isn't making more sense on on campuses across this country
well I think it does make sense you know if you look at all the poll numbers where I'm you know really winning by a lot
and even the book is selling like crazy the problem is I can't you know I can only sign so many of them and a lot of people want them side but and I just don't have time to do that I don't have time to really promote the book but the book is done great and it's been very successful you know what I was thinking about with you just moments ago
and I thought this is a very good quality to have in a president and I think it's one I humbly suggest you you hit upon which is
you delegate you must delegate you cannot do what you do without a ton of delegating and a good leader does that and can do that effectively
well you know you're right but I still have to sign the book I mean that's my one thing I'd love to delegate somebody else but I really have to sign the book myself so you know that's part of the deal
but it's it's been I've been it's been really fantastic it's done really really well and in its own way out of its you know it's it's not just what's wrong it's how to fix it and it sort of pertains to what I'm doing and what it's all about cuz our country is in serious trouble
are infrastructure is a disaster and you know you look at so many different things whether it's Obamacare the military
the Vets who aren't properly taken care of it's so many problems Adam
I did the book I wanted to do the book I was assignment at Schuster's been an amazing you know they've done an amazing job we did it very quickly
I should tell people that as I was listening to the book last night
he was talking in the book about the first debate the second debate things that seem to happen a week or two ago I was trying to figure out
you know most books are written a year in advance
fantastic book publishing company
one of the things I wanted to do a speed I said look I don't I didn't want to do a book they can't they came up and they said we'd love to have it
and we had to do it very quickly and we took a tremendous you know we really crammed like I'd say in college right we crammed
we got it done and it really is very current it's probably we did the book in like a month and they got it printed so quickly it was incredible and so I was impressed with the job they did can you tell me what your schedule is because I think about it all the time how much do you sleep what time do you go to bed I know you're all over the place you're traveling it's all over the place but in general
well you know it depends on what season we're talking about because I do different things and I am I'm all over the place now it's it's really the campaign for the most part and you know my children you know them
and they like you and respect you a lot and you know through the apprentice and
honestly it's it's pretty wild times I don't do the vacation thing very much and if I do I always go to my own places cuz I have great places where do you sleep how many hours do you sleep at night and you know because I enjoy what I'm doing and sometimes less than that what's what's for breakfast
well I tried to get breakfast as much as possible I mean I try and Skip breakfast as much as possible if I can avoid it I don't have breakfast off lunch
sometimes dinner but I usually skip breakfast
so its 4 or 5 hours of sleep skip breakfast and go to work I'll be in the office at 7:00
6 or 7:00 I'll work a little bit I'll make calls I'll study up on what's going on I'll sometimes oftentimes have to go out for dinner
which I consider to be not a luxury I'd rather stay home then be staying home as a luxury isn't crazy I've had an interesting life and I've you know it's really been amazing what's going on with the presidential campaign you see that right listen I love it I really love it and I just I think I was saying to somebody
a lot of it is
Ian a response to wear this country's been going and who's been leading it over the last several years it's been not a good situation we owe 19 trillion I mean the country is a mess it's an absolute mess and it's been so badly handled and you look at what's going on now with even the Aranda you take the Iran deal with we're spending $150 we're giving a
150 billion and losing every single point of a deal
they want to negotiate for prisoners
can you tell me what you would do with airport security
well it's got to be strengthened and then it's got to be and you know we have technology now that's so good and so strong
most of the places don't even have the new technology and a good technology
but we have you know the airport stuff is dangerous but we have much better technology than they using at airport
and we have to get the right stuff and we have to have the best technology
the immigration part which started well it
early on in the book first Donald talked about at The Prince and illegal immigration
frankly there was a firestorm and then all of a sudden a couple of weeks later people are saying wow I think he's right
you know you look at what happened with Kate and San Francisco and Jamil
in the young guy was
to death by an illegal immigrant that should have been in the country
how many different things have happened then it has been it's been amazing I mean what's going on is amazing I'm very proud of the fact that
illegal immigration is now a very very major Topic in the end of debate why I never could understand it I was just like whatever the laws are just enforce the laws and then that'll be that
well the laws need to strengthening but the laws are still there and we have the opposite they totally circumvent the laws and the government circumvents the laws even
it's it's a disgraceful situation but
you know what I think we have it right where we're going to want it and if I win
you're not going to have a legal immigration I mean it's going to be a whole different picture
I do I did like in the debate when you said you'll build a wall and by the way you're very good at building walls but you also said
in the book you said you'd get Mexico to pay for it how do you do that
Mexico will pay for the wall because we that Mexico makes a fortune off
and they're coming across from all over the southern border we call it and they're coming across from all over Adam and Mexico's going to pay for the wall Mexico is not helping us and I love the people of Mexico frankly and I respect the leaders of Mexico but they're much too smart for our leaders our leaders don't know what they're doing not smart enough not cunning enough
but the people of Mexico are you know I have tremendous numbers of Hispanics working for me
and they love me and I love them I'm in the whole thing but what's happening with Mexico on the border is horrible
show Mexico is going to pay for it they make so much money from us Adam so much more than we're talking about for the cost of a wall you watch now no politicians going to have that done and you know no politicians getting Mexico to pay you watch you call me up in a couple of years from now and if I don't speak to you soon
is going to pay for the wall
all right that is a that is a guarantee because I live in California
billions of dollars off
we're giving them hundreds of millions of dollars
if you look at the trade deficit that we have with Mexico
and and you look at the imbalance that we have with Mexico the wall is a fraction of that so it's the answer is it's going to be done Ted Cruz was on yesterday told me about his tax plan it sounded too good to be true
what is a different planet than me I need to buy the way it happens to be a good guy I think so too it just sounded too good to be true 10%
it's a little bit I'm not a huge fan of the flat tax because it doesn't take care of it a person making a lot of money
maybe you should pay more than a person that's making practically nothing you understand
my plan is a simplification it's going to be simple it's going to be a major tax
for businesses and for middle the middle income people
and it's going to be a plan that absolutely works and it's going to make it a dynamic economy and that's what I've done all my life out of you know that I've created jobs tens of thousands of jobs
but my plan is going to work a lot of people like the flat tax I mean look I'll tell you what anything is better than what we have right now that I can tell you what if Hillary Clinton gets in what are the next four years going to be like well I don't think she's going to get in and the fox say came out just recently and it has to be beating her but I don't think Hillary Clinton's going to get in she's done too bad a job
she doesn't have the strength she doesn't have the stamina to be president and she's done a terrible job so I don't think she's going to get it if I get nominated she will not get
I like that
sure that you're going to get nominated
Monmouth Paul just came out I think it's 41 to 14 or 15
that's pretty good 41% versus 15% or 14 the
and others are coming out at 38% and and you know numbers much lower than that so it's you know I'm doing I'm doing very well and we'll see what happens I mean you know who
who can say for sure but right now I'm leaving by a lot can I give you a quick compliment
yes people because I did Celebrity Apprentice all the time said to me like what kind of guy is Trump and obviously you know there's a lot of people specially in the town I live in that have some unkind things to say about you
okay and I said you know I judge a guy by how his children
treat him and how his children respect
him or
so you show me a guy who has a son and haven't spoken in 25 years I don't think that's a good dude
but I see and saw the way your kids are around you
and I see the respect they have for you and that they choose to work with you
and how they turned out
sorry for the language calling you a douchebag I would say
his kids respect him his kids look up to him and his kids work with him
he's got to be a good guy
well I'm going to tell you your audience that my kids also respect you and so do I but my kids are also respect you at him so that that means a lot otherwise I wouldn't be doing this call well my kids have a lot of respect and I told him I was doing Ivanka actually
and she said you got you have to say hello to Adam for me so
Ivanka and Eric and Don actually say hello well I've often times describe Ivanka is just one of the most impressive people I've ever met my life I've never seen someone so smart so put together so incredible usually get one or the other you know you get the looks of the brains or the work ethic or you get the blonde hair but they don't want to work or you get to work ethic but you get the frizzy hair her her her her thing is just an it's an amazing and I'm proud of you too cuz I hear your thing is going well and I hope that this interview last night was so great I mean it was the show was
he's a great guy he is a great thing he did he pulled out we were talking about it because it's funny because I saw him right after he spoke to you so I had to go home that evening and then watch it after I talk to him so he got to sort of describe to me pulling out the children's book and doing the whole nine yards but yeah he had a great time with you and I tell you something America how to make America great again and you can go to the website Donald J trump.com
1726 coming up next we have Adam Carolla show 3529 Bernard Hopkins Shawn Porter and RJ Bell know Sean Porter this portion he comes right to tell end of this clip business for 2023 Adam and Mike August want to radio row hope you guys enjoy
you know it's like we were talking about
legendary fighters of yore and
Joe Louis did so much
for this country and so much for the sport and then he retired and then he owed the IRS a bunch of money and they're like now you got to go fight a bunch of tomato cans for the rest of your life so you can pay us back like thanks government
that's a fine how do you do for a guy who who did so much for this country but all right let's not let's not take grass I made a couple of notes sort of Vegas Centric and I want okay well I'm ready I want your thoughts on a few things
what is
I went to a steakhouse last night
and I was looking at the sign in front of the steakhouse nice steakhouse
add
at a certain point
I got to the women's section
no slippers
can you imagine any other point in history where one would wear slippers into a steakhouse a fine Steakhouse in Las Vegas in the evening
they said no hats
you know because traditionally guys would wear Derbies and fedoras Frank Sinatra would have worn a Fedor
indoor Steakhouse in 1957 in Vegas he may have not gone in without the Hat do you know when hat started dropping off when JFK got shot
interesting that
when we entered an establishment
back in the day we like the ritual
kind of
undressing a little bit like you'd walk in
and you stand there and you'd hand someone your hat and your hand them your coat Like Your Overcoat you know there's a lot of like here take this shit hey poor person hear some junk
take it award
keep track of it I'll come back and then I'll give you $3 I thought you were going to say you were going to unbuckle your pants when you ate
give me
having to tell people you can't wear slippers in a one piece into a steakhouse let me do a little Vegas take on know this Steakhouse was in LA
for a long time it was the nicest restaurant in Vegas and I always wanted to go there and I could have went but I just never had the opportunity well there was a guy who was playing Blackjack big like 30000 a hand
he shows up with flip flops
he shows up like literally with flip flops and bath or like swimwear
and there's literally like a do
authentic Picasso's on the wall
in Vegas doesn't care baby cuz it's the ultimate democracy of money if you if you're going to if you got the money you can wear whatever you want
next
not necessarily Vegas related but you guys tell me
I think about Ryan Seacrest
is a hard worker
he's a
limited talent-wise so that does a nice job
I'm seeing but you know no one ever said is very popular right now but people are dumb and no one ever said did you hear what Ryan Seacrest
so here's my challenge
how much does his success
have to do with having a good name because he doesn't do anything
if you're
Louis CK or something it doesn't it Dave Chappelle like it doesn't really matter they do something we care about what they do
seat warmers
I think the name helps I always bring up actress Minnie Driver
I don't know how talented she is I don't know how good-looking she is but everyone like to say Minnie Driver we've got many driver on this project
did Ryan Seacrest and he knew he had a hot name or he wouldn't have gone Seacrest
everyone loves to disagree
I'm saying
did it help him 5% it's not it didn't it didn't make his career I'm saying how much does a name help how much did the drivers you disagree with 1%
I think it hurt her because is it mini or mini I don't even know where the name is Minnie Driver
is a good name once he became popular but the first time you heard right the first time you heard that name it was unusual in a way that I don't think was an advantage all right but once you became popular then it got 18 other shows okay so there was negativity in the name initially I don't know negativity maybe nutrition on it
do you know anyone else named Seacrest now so I know Mimi from Tucson but you don't know what other Secret
it's a very unique name
you say Sea Crest didn't get him in the door I agree but he's done did 180 shows since he got in the door I'm saying people like his name is good for 5% that's what I'm saying a percentage let me ask you a question have you had the and I am a huge fan of yours but no I'm serious because you're straight talker and to me and you're willing to do it when it's unpopular that's the key to me that's me now
do you think you've had a success that you you know I saw your movie in the theater rode hard I don't know many people saw that in the theater but I did in Vegas and obviously there was the motif of while your partner did a lot better at least in the sense of
do you feel like that you
underperformed and if so why not perform but the success hasn't been there because you're very successful millions of them but what I'm saying is not at that next level
why do you think that is
there are two components to any business
how are you at the skill of The Craft of the business
and then there's a secondary part of it that's sort of political and that's why people take clients out to dinner you know and we're going to bring clients to strip clubs and and are you a company man I think that's the way to say right yeah I mean yeah I think there's a way Hollywood is a specialist way you know boxing not so much
Sledgehammer for right hand you'll just keep keep getting paid and keep Rollin
Hollywood and Anna but many Industries have both components to it Hollywood Mayhem in in boxing
you cannot be
a complete lunatic you know what I mean you can you could be an asshole you could be temperamental
but you can't be oh shit who's the guy who's the
play defensive end for the Green Bay Packers
crazy
50/50 Talent 50/50 who do you know how do you what are your relationships how do you play the game how did you come down on covid did you say the right things after covid you say the wrong place after covid did you vote for Trump did you not vote for Trump where are you with many many many different subject
and if you are not down with the 50%
hampered to that degree
now would you say your political beliefs were a problem up until they say before 3:40 years ago
it was Trump that upset people on the lap so much so
that when I go and do if I go to a show
I'll have a camera guy like walk up to me look over shoulder and go I agree with you but we got to keep it pretty down because the left will fire his ass if they find out that he disagrees with them
Trump
and you're in the middle everybody got shifted left and the guys in the middle now are on the right side of the spectrum so that's what I was in 100% against Trump you were sympathizer Adam was in the Middle School just because you have to come out so far left we had to come out against Trump right if you did not come out against Trump and your silence definition
then who was the alternative Hillary Clinton
politicians is the country running like a Swiss time piece like Joe Biden came in and fucked everything up in two and a half years I
so who are you talking about like forget about Trump
fantastic president or do you think Joe Biden is doing an awesome job as president and I'm going to put it back on you fine you hate Trump good tell me all about Joe Biden and how he's performing tell me about the economy tell me about fuel prices tell me about energy Independence tell me about the Border you tell me about
skirmishes abroad you you tell me how he's doing I'll just ask I'll put the question back to the person who hates Trump tell me about your body so I heard you interview Trump when he was a candidate on this show and it was like a 2020 25 minute interview and from that day till today do you think more or less of trump
here's the thing about Trump trump drives narcissist in
you have to be a narcissist to go insane and there's a lot of narciss
I didn't know how many narcissists there were until covid came around and people started yelling at people walking on hiking trails to put their masks on like we we ended up having a lot of narcissists in this country they drive narcissists insane if you're a non-narcotic
if you don't care about any of that because none of that affects me but you do care about policy then you can like
cuz his policy and many many Arenas were strong like he's sitting and telling NATO you don't want him he's telling Germany don't take oil from Russia you'll be beholding the Russia you better and I'm not going to pay the tab for NATO you guys got to chip in like
pragmatic sensible things he's trying to buy
when gas was when fuel
the cheapest it was a barrel
Obama would be much funner guy to have a beer with than Trump
what if you're never going to have that be
the first one
I don't really care about any of the rhetoric I don't care about good or bad I don't
Hillary Clinton would talk about you know equality and everyone needs to be treated with dignity and when you come to this country deserve a seat at the table okay none of that's going to happen and then Trump would talk about other blow Hardy things and none of that was going to happen I just want to get down to policy I'm just pragmatic but you just said the population
1000 things that didn't make sense and they all started doing it and they all started enforcing it they enforce it
do you think Trump could have won in 16 if he wasn't blow Hardy to use your phrase you mean
I mean I think it was here's what it is it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's Savory and sweet Savory and sweet we as human beings
to go all right we've had some
we like to go back and forth and back and forth in the history of politics
we had eight years of Obama being sweet and now we want Savory and then we had four years of savory then we want to go back to sweet like we as human beings that were literally wired
to just go back and forth from salty from salt to sugar you know will will will will will do that
Ross Perot 19%
that was amazing it was like oh my God a third Trump came in and
who's the analogy of the other Trump meaning there's been no one there's been a bunch of guys that run for his magazine that wanted to be president or Rockefeller became governor of New York like all these billionaires of tried that he's the only one to do it and I wonder why you think that is
what is his unique talent that allowed him to do something no human has ever done enough okay he what he did is
after 4 after 8 years or whatever all right so all right so we'll break it down
his opposition they will say the Democrats but like
Obama I mean he run against it but you know it says Obama and Hillary Clinton
is there angle is to come out and go
global warming were the cause of a lot of the pollution and where the cause you know we invented slavery you know it's a lot of like you know there's kids go to bed hungry every night
so like there's two ways you vote from for somebody
if you lived in a in a condo complex and you're trying to figure out who's going to be the building manager one guy would go out and go
there's roach infestation the pool needs to be scammed with the pools unusable we got to put a new roof on this place this place is a rack and you go all right that's that's a way to go like a vote for that guy and then the other guy gets out there and he goes I'm going to turn this place into Shangri-La
I'm going to make this the nicest kind of we will be the Envy of every kind of people will come to us and beg us to do what I'm going to do for because we're we're the best condo already
you're so after 8 years of this place is ruined and it's filled with cockroaches and this is miserable you go just show up with some good news I want some good and then so Trump so Hillary Clinton is up there talking about women's rights being splashed and African-American rights and brown people and Trump just walking out going we're number one
you'll never flourish like a flourish
I just got to be faster and you not to
all you had to be to be the contractor Obama was a little bit less like or less like Obama you didn't have to be one of the most extreme politicians we've ever seen Extreme as in his style of being a politician interrupt your political dietary

the Adam Carolla show presents Tucker Carlson's birthday cocktail party for May 16th let's see who's here let's welcome the inventor of the microphone David Edward Hughes American serial killer HH Holmes former manager for the New York Yankees and the Oakland A's Billy Martin Henry Fonda's officer for the Soviet Union period
I want to talk to you so I always think about this clip and I'm sure you've seen it to where Schumer
what's on on with Rachel Maddow in January 2017 and basically said why is Trump agitating
CIA CIA FBI these these agencies why is he agitating and then he says the quiet part out loud they will destroy you
which I
turned out to be
a lot of what we saw
but at the very end
it's a little Part I
and I think
so even for a practical supposedly hard-nosed businessman he's being really dumb to do this what do you think the intelligence Community would do if they don't know but from what I am told they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them and we need the intelligence Community we don't know what's going on look at the Russian hacking
then he goes on to say something that didn't happen that the intelligence Community cooked up to take down Trump
as an example of why we need
that's the end of democracy
speaking of the housekeeper taking over the house
shut up and make the
the point of the CIA as originally
was to inform the president of what's going on around the world so you can make better foreign policy decisions so the Intel Gathering apparatus of the US president they work for him
they have no constitutional legitimacy outside of him
the people who are elected by the public
have all
they have employees to whom they delegate that power to get things done but those employees have no independent power at all and no independent legitimacy the CIA is a totally illegitimate
criminal organization unless it is following precisely the orders of the elected president democrat or republican doesn't matter
so he's describing a crime
it's unbelievable and it's happening in front of all of us and nobody seems to care
but you know as the country declines in the Democratic institutions weekend and you wonder how did this happen well that's how it happened right there
what do you
the future holds
I mean are they going to let Trump be president of course I mean look if you know they protested
they impeached him twice on ridiculous pretenses they
fabricated a lot about what happened on January 6th in order to impeach him again it didn't work
he came back
it didn't work he became more popular
criticism then you go to protest then you go to impeachment now you go to indictment and none of them work what's
we're speeding toward assassination obviously
and no one will say that but I don't I don't know how you can reach that conclusion
permanent Washington both parties have decided
they're putting him on trial in March of next year in the j6 case
which basically consists of trying to send him to prison for the rest of his life for complaining about the last election that's literally what it is
I'm not I don't
in a way that's impossible to deny
well I think
if we should have break it down into sort of steps or chapters
we have this and then a possible solution at the end of the book so
a chapter 1 the government is doing what they've been doing and we've not been aware of it for most of its existence we just sort of went along with it you know but the government
is big and it's deep and
it's very interested in hanging on to its power and all the agencies we've been we've mentioned before this
that's number one number two the part that most Americans didn't see coming is how the media was also very complicit in this and got sucked into the governmental side of it because they're the town criers they're going to have to ring the bell and inform everyone in the town what the government is doing
so in certain cases
when it comes to Trump and Russian collusion and Putin's puppet that they need to add a lot of creatine to and steroids to and really build that thing up if not create it from Whole cloth when it comes to 100 Bynes laptop that needs to be crushed and smashed when it comes to covid fauci needs to be elevated and anybody in the great Berrington declaration needs to be pulled off of Twitter and Destroy so that's the media and that's what they're
then that trickles down to the people and then when you talk to most people they're really just saying what they heard from the media who they think is unbiased but is really doing the work of the government so now we have a triple threat we have the government doing what they need to do they have the media with their marching orders and then there's the good people of the village who really don't know what's going on they just watch CNN or they watch Rachel Rachel Maddow talk to Chuck Schumer and they go well that must be the way the way it is and they get sucked into it and almost can't be blamed because they're more naive than they are evil for sure
the average citizen now
there are people like yourself
and there's all these other entities and there's all these other platforms and they can no longer Corral everybody the the Sheep are getting over the fence the gate got knocked open and now there's a lot of different voices from a lot of different places and really for the first time I'm hearing sort of normal non-political people asking questions about Biden or the laptop or Russian collusion or what their persecution of trump and that kind of stuff and the question is is can voice is like yourself and there's alternative media platforms
can they arrive in time to stop
here's my view of
I think the lies are are unsustainable lying is always unsustainable you're always found out in the end weather in your lifetime or posthumously but you know wiser always revealed by their nature and
that it's going to be very clear to the majority of Voters before the election
and that makes everything much more intense
and so if your goal is to maintain power
and if you think
there will be a hot war between the United States and Russia
in the next year
but that's a separate analysis but I think it's a political matter they need to declare war footing
so if you're worried about our politics getting like even more vicious
to force a
Ukrainian Army outside of NATO
we are going to war with Russia and of course the stakes are
anyway
all this stupid Republican Senators and McCarthy in the house I mean it's pathetic
these people are all on board with the war against Russia why
I think it may even be scarier cuz you say they believe masks work or they believe men can become women and so on and so
I don't know that they believe that
to hang on to power who was you know against the Soviets when it mattered
when they existed
but maybe the only person in the United States who doesn't really have very strong feelings about Russia
and talk to smart people on both sides like it doesn't matter what their politics are and ask them like what what
do you think the war in Ukraine has had on American leadership in Europe
is not possible to repair at least in the short-term well speaking of Russia I have one more clip to play which I'm always delighted by
and I think you've seen the clip and everyone's seen and heard the clip but they forgot about
what happened at the end of the clip which which I thought was very telling
which is and I know it's a subject that's near and dear to your heart which is us just arguing about race
non
we're on the brink of a hot war with Russia and we're just arguing about race constantly which always feels like part of the plan in terms of a distraction
but I'll play this clip from the October 2020 debate with
Will trump and Biden but the part you need to really listen to is the part where they want to get back to the subject at
let me ask some photos please respond to this weekend if this is true then he's a corrupt politician so don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby Joe they're calling you a corrupt politician I want to say we're talking about
who said that what this he's accusing me of is a Russian
they have said that this is has all the four five former heads of the CIA both parties say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage
nobody believes that accept them his and his good friend Rudy you mean the laptop is now another Russia Russia Russia hoax and that's exactly what this thing is exactly what is so where he's going the last stop
you know you look back and
people's views change over time so we're 3 years from that
Mass have been I think thoroughly discredited as a means of prophylactic protection
college educated American women have been totally discredited by the behavior of that specimen and many others
there's a certain upper income college-educated American woman who is despised by like literally everybody in the country I'm sorry to say it's just true it's just totally everyone knows what I'm talking about this different names from Karen
category it's probably 15% of the total American population they have wildly disproportionate power over everything but they mostly have cultural power
race
I don't think in the next election or any future election people like that whoever that moderator was
will ever be taken seriously again I mean
off God from your mouth to God's ears maybe the only good thing of this chapter our country is in is how fast the experts and the college educated are just completely being defunct they're just that we're never going to listen to Rochelle Wollensky again talk about you know covid any of the show called experts
not listening anymore to those people but it was very telling
that we try to mire ourselves in race in this country and it has to be intentional there's just not enough of it racism to go around and so
Kristen Welker was the name of the moderator by the way so we have to just go back to arguing about race and I just found it
informative that we were trying to talk about Russia and talk about Ukraine and that particular case but we wanted to get back to arguing about race nobody actually wants to talk about like you're not allowed to talk about race in any sense other than
the other side apologizes for being white like that's the that's the totality of our racial conversation like they're probably some interesting conversations you could have about racing be fired immediately if you tried all right I'm not that interested in the topic because I consider a race like height and eye color or something that you know you're not responsible for and you can't change so you know there are certain realities associated with it but we'll accept them and move on I don't find it interesting I don't talk about it unless I have to
but of course it's completely a distraction
design to get you not to notice they're loading the country they're literally looting the country
walking through Nancy Pelosi's office bringing a trump flag into Congress I can get you shot to death no problem but like making up a fake cryptocurrency and looting a billion dollars wow he's a nice kid you know it's like they're looting the country they don't want you to see it fight amongst yourselves while we steal that's exactly
all right well you know maybe the late great Charles Manson had it right when he was trying to start a race war in 1971 and then take power
it's just an unbelievable clearly you know a federal agents too strong but a source there's an amazing book and unfortunately I'm 54 so I forget book titles now but I read it last year
no but that sounds like an app title
I can't quite do it justice but there's a reassessment of
the Manson family written by a liberal celebrity profiler from LA
Bianca killings and ended up spending the next 20 years writing this book which I'm sure most of your audience is right I feel like I was the only person who had read it to my son gave it to me but it's fast but basically
concludes with a lot of evidence
is that the federal all over that story I'm not saying
pause the murders
it's a lot more complicated than we thought it was I have I have the title chaos Charles Manson the CIA and the secret history of the 60s and you'll know I mean it's about La so you'll know everything
