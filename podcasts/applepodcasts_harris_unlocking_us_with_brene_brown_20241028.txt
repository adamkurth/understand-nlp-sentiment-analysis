I want to see a few things about the podcast before we jump right into it the first is
I am an Unapologetic
Harris wall suppor
I have studied leadership for the last couple of decades I have been inside of many many of the Fortune 100 companies kind of in this country and around the world inside of ngos worked with military leaders leadership is something that's really important to me and
this conversation is really the conversation that I insist on having
with CEOs and executive directors and Military commanders before I agree to do work within their organization you know if you take a CEO and corporate sector I can listen to earnings calls I can track stocks I can read engagement data and performance data
but what's really important to me is to sit down with a leader
and understand their capacity for full presence
understand their values understand what they believe in
why they're fighting for what they're fighting for and that's what this conversation is
I think vice president Harris has done an incredible job speaking to policy writing about policy if you go to her website there's detailed policy everything from foreign policy Economic Policy abortion
guns the things that matter from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep
this is a conversation about who is she what does she believe in why is she fighting
I will tell you that
in terms of high-performance high-stress leaders
I've met very few as solid as vice president Harris I'm excited to bring you into the conversation
vice president
vice president Kamala Harris welcome to us thank you
thrilled and ready to dig in
we're going to start where we start all of these
tell us your story
and start from the very beginning
I've heard bits and pieces but I want to I'm going to ask hard questions along the way okay okay so I am one of two daughters who we were raised primarily by my mother my parents divorced when I was five and I'm the eldest and my mother had two goals in her life to raise her two daughters and to end breast cancer
and one of the very few women and certainly one of the very few women of color and a lot of my
work on women's health was formed you know
growing up
listening to her and watching her passion about the need for women to have dignity in the Healthcare System we grew up in an incredible neighborhood where
the kids we would ride our bikes
and so I had the blessing of a really great childhood because it was like it was a working-class neighborhood of you know I tried to explain to people
have you ever known a neighborhood where people are they're proud of their lawn oh yeah
you know what I mean
out
Trim in their roses out there mowing their lawn and just pride and neighborhood pride and Community it was the kids of the community
we were raised
where I talked about this which is that I had
and have an incredible family
and it is the family that I have that is by Blood and it is the family that I have by love
and that's how I was raised that you create your family as much as you are born into your family right right
and so I grew up with you know this expectation also
a joke about it we were raised in a community of people that told all of us as kids that we were special
we weren't particularly special but
they told us we were and we believed them right and I think that
in parenting
there are certain things that we do for the children in our lives that teachers do so beautifully that we can all do that is just about
inspiring a kid
believe that they are loved and they are special
and then you create a high standard for them and they know they're supposed to rise to it you know I mean I see you right yeah and I see
and that's it that's it and that's it and then when you do that
do you know how kids are specially you know like 12 and under and you tell them that and they just start walking around with their chest out on their
and that's one of the best things you can give a child
and then you let them explore and you and you tell them they are special which also means and we expect a lot of them so that was I'm going to pause you here okay
because this is if you look at the parenting research
this follow-up piece is
which is not your special
and you don't have to work at anything not your special and you don't have to do anything you're special and therefore therefore
I mean I was part of and I am like this with our kids and with you know I have baby nieces so I just left pieces they're my niece's children and when you turn into like your twenties and then you look at your parents and you're like these are all the things you did wrong right
and I remember saying to my mother
you never took my side
because
if I came home with any problem
and talk to my mother about it the first thing she would do is not oh honey come here let me hug you
oh honey let me take care of it the first thing she would do is look at you and say
what did you do
later
is that she was teaching me and us
reflect on what your agency was at that moment
and what was your responsibility and to the extent that you can
control it don't let things happen to you
okay I have to pause you again here because this is my nerdy research thing
emotion of possibility hope is actually
mostly taught by parents and a learned cognitive behavioral process what's interesting about it
is the positive correlation between hopefulness and a sense of agency
yeah yeah I see as you say that I see that yeah so hope is actually three this is CR Schneider's work out of Kansas hope is
goal I can set a goal pathway I can find a path to it that includes Plan B C D and E of plan a doesn't work
rent agency I believe in my ability to do it
play The Hope is the driver exactly about
let's talk about your agency here
in a way that also requires you
I think it's very important to also in any situation and certainly it's a rule for today among those who call themselves leaders
think about it in the context of reflection
because also requires reflection
what happened
what could have happened
what role did I play and what happened and what role did I play
it could be something where you should critically analyze it
or to know that that is the that there's a lesson learned right
I mean it's a Hallmark of courageous leadership it's a Hallmark of our leadership work is that your ability anytime you're giving corrective feedback or coaching
to anticipate you're going to have a part
as a leader I'm very hard on myself
and one of the things that I feel and take very seriously is my responsibility to be
prepared
also I've got this little thing about it's really important to me to be on time to track someone tease me recently was worked with a lot of elected leaders and like I've never seen an elected leaders all the time but I feel
that I owe other people to respect of knowing your time is important right and it's the very least I can do is respect that
in terms of what they've had to do in their day to meet with me
what Dave had to put aside to do that
but there are these things that are about just what is your role in a moment
of responsibility
and also dut
and I gave a speech years ago
about the distinction that I see between
Duty and char
will I have a little extra to give and I will be a benevolent
and I will give you some of what I have
is the responsibility that you have is not an option know it is a responsibility you should not expect to be applauded for it because it is actually what you're supposed to do and I connect that to something I've seen my whole life and then most recently when I visited the aftermath of hurricane Helene
and I went to a lot of the relief centers and you've probably seen this houstonian
and what you've probably seen there and I've seen throughout my life
it is often the case that the people who have the least to give
give the most
100 the time right I mean we actually see that in the research on charitable giving right it's incredible
it's incredible
and that's what I mean about dut
it's not if you
I have two pennies I give you one
tell me it makes me
it just makes me emotional as somebody who's lived through
it takes me back to Harvey when the people getting us out of our home we're part of the Cajun Navy they were fishermen right yeah
Gator fan boats all kinds of stuff with all kinds of interesting to moms on them but they were they were putting us in those boats and so
I have to ask you a question and you can just say I'm wrong I'm sensing some serious firstborn energy here but there is certainly something to birth order period
being told look after your sister
put the toilet lid down are your sisters will die you get a pretty big sense of like wow every decision I make has pretty big consequences right okay I've got to ask you this question you get to Howard
I heard it was a houstonian
that term that created the term is it is it c ^ 3 was the name that I was given by my sorority when I joined the sorority we all had our nickname and that was mine and it stands for cool calm and collected so yes that was a very long time ago and that was the name I was given I had to track it back because I actually started the research on the short hair cut yeah oh you did yeah because someone sent it to me
in this moment of excitement about you running and said she had to listen to Depeche Mode look at the haircut we're going hard and I was like okay my husband loves Depeche Mode and I am not it's not my thing it's just so that's funny you say that but
I did have that shortcut but that was like those days it was those days but you know what you're right it wasn't the the person who kind of managed our sorority when I joined was a houstonian
so yes I love the story yes yes yes
okay first time you fell in love
oh goodness in high school did you did you get your heart broken or did you break someone's heart
I didn't get my heart broken I kind of just
you know Brothers also I mean
but my best friend from kindergarten is still one of my best friends know in fact she's been out campaigning for me in North Carolina knocking on doors let's go right
I love my girlfriends like I we have a Sisterhood like I have
my sister and in addition My Chosen sisters
who we have traveled life together right I am godmother to their children our husbands are like brothers right and it's a big part of my life
it's a big part of my life and it's a big part of
a mentor a lot of women and men
including our kids including
adult
know that again let's get back to agency know you have a choice
who will be in your friend Circle
and
those people who
are you going to root for you those people who are not going to judge you but at the same time we're going to say
girl you need a mint those who will laugh with you when you trip and fall and then they'll pull you back up and push you out
and and sometimes I just simplify this way cuz I did that a long time ago in my life
I'm not going to have mean friends
but you have to be you have to be intentional about these things
especially if you ever experienced I mean one of the things that we do with our kids is we do this little metaphor where we have them put a little like pretend there's a flame in their hand and say when you get really Bright and Shine make sure you don't hang out with anyone that comes by and blows it out because your lights too that's beautiful just like you want someone that says that's right and and we have to teach and including other adults you actually you have
the
to not have mean people in your life and to sit back and actually be intentional about
how do people make you feel and it doesn't mean that people are just blowing smoke that feels bad too actually does and it will not take you to a good place no right and there's no trust in that no but there's not and there's no safety in that either right
how someone treats you says more about you than them how you allow them to treat you as more about you
adult friendships
that's good work it's work that can be joyful
an important yeah it can be hard but
the most important people in my life identical twins
when my parents brought them home in New Orleans I was like
holy crap are both of them Staind like this is a lot and my brothers between us so answer your question period
well you and I have had that experience of our mother's passing and and what
and during an illness what that does right cuz it's interesting the relationship between adults siblings in the context of your parents
can have the effect of having you revert to your 12 year old self oh my God I mean all the sudden right like Scooby-Doo is on and the world but you are just back to me it's not pretty they push the buttons because they install them you know that's good because I have a question for you so
we've been studying like courageous leadership during leadership for 15 years we have found that daring leaders often have one or two values that are core to them and we all have a lot of values but one or two that are core where every other value is forged what would you say as a leader that your primary one or two values
how would you identify them
yeah they're probably directly connected
fairness and justice
that's really really important to me and Justice I mean I have
I mean I it is it prompts me to act if I if
see something that is
unjust or unfair
and at the same time fighting for that for others is something that is a real motivator of mine and actually will you know cause me to have a very almost emotional
feeling about the importance of
fairness and justice
okay another leadership question
I've been watching you
you're making a funny joke and it's interesting I see in you
there's a generational difference in leadership so folks who are
1015 20th older than us come from a brand of leadership that is very command and control
it's somewhat ego protective and our generation is kind of caught in between that and
highly collaborative
bright Haile Coalition building absolutely
and in the best moments
surrounding ourselves by experts
who are high performers have deep knowledge and understanding and great strategy skills
you seem to move toward Coalition and collaborative leadership is that a fair assessment
my lived experience is to know that the vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us and Okay so
I love nobody over 40% volume
but I just think that if we work toward
Coalition building we are stronger as a society I just know it and I know that when you bring together
seemingly different people
and you bring people around a table you can watch
the silos breakdown
and everyone leaves a bit tall
evolving in some ways devolving
people are feeling alone
and when you feel alone it's very disempowering
when we can bring people together
and they see the commonality it is then empowering of the individual
as well as what it does for the collect that's right that's right yeah I mean that's
that's actually the secret sauce of high-performing teams and it doesn't matter whether I'm working with a corporate team and NGO team a military special that that is you're not alone and
we are more like than we're different
I have to say something now cuz I'm getting I'm trying to win the over-under on not cussing during the podcast but okay I have to say this what you're describing is very different than what I saw from the previous Trump Administration and certainly a start difference in what he's committing to do in the next 4 years if he's president and I want to talk about something really specific and this is very difficult for me just as a woman as a person but also someone who is study leadership for decades
he's talking about loyalists not experts in positions of authority
people that will serve him
not our country
including most recently a comment
about using the military against Americans who disagree with him
the anime was in he talks about the Enemy Within
American citizens
I have to understand or I want to understand I don't have to understand but I want to understand
if I were working in an organization of Fortune 100 company
and I saw a leader surrounding
himself or herself with loyalists who serve
a person
rather than a mission and a purpose and shareholders are aboard that would last 5 Seconds
do you think this fear about
putting loyalists in place
is it is a real fear it is a very real fear
and we have heard
look the people who know Donald Trump best who worked with him
members of his political party
who worked with him inside the Oval Office inside the Situation Room
who were his chief of staff most recently the one who spoke out of four star Marine General
his National Security advisor two secretaries of defense and his former vice president
have all said he is unfit
to serve as president and he is dangerous
Donald Trump is someone who has said he would terminate the Constitution of the United States
I have taken the o
to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States six times
twice as de twice as Attorney General of the United States Senator announced vice president
they are very few
you know when do you say you make to your spouse to God but to the Constitution of the United States
is the highest dut
the most sacred
did any office holders specially president of the United States
and this man says he would terminate the Constitution of the United States
I'm talking about enemies within I mean that Harkens back to like McCarthyism know yeah I mean it's like a straight line it's a short line it's a short walk
and and
the fear
is real and legitimate and very well founded but what I urge everyone to do is
do something with that fear which is understand that
as long as we hold on to it have a democracy
and in a democracy in our country the people have the power through their vote
to determine
who will be their leaders and who will be president of the United States and the direction of our country right now we are truly at an inflection point
we are truly at an inflection point
authoritarian rule does not come
into power
with 1950s grainy black and white movies of Tanks rolling in organs being held to people's heads
what's happening is we vote someone in
and so this yeah the Enemy Within

do you feel like your leads never lead anywhere and you're making content that no one sees and it takes forever to build a campaign well that's why we build up spot
campaigns for you tells you which leads are worth knowing and makes writing blogs creating videos and posting on social a breeze
so now it's easier than ever to be a marketer get started at hubspot.com
can I run something by you
it's it's a theory that I have about what's going on what I see going on and I see it from a different perspective than probably political cuz I study human behavior and emotion
I actually get the attraction of the Trump Vance approach and I'm going to tell you why I get it
I get it because
we are not neurobiological hardwired for uncertainty Antonio damasio is a neuroscientist he always said don't ever believe that we're thinking machines
who have feelings we are feeling machines who on occasion
and so which is the key to the survival of the species which is the key to the survival of the species and so what ends up happening I think with this kind of
is
it is really good reality television it is kind of what we would call the social sciences emotional pornography that the country is somewhat numb to a base level of emotion I think as we've been through so much the last few years that it takes extraordinary emotion to get our attention
add the bigger and the Blustery the emotion
and what ends up happening is a strategy of emotional
just kind of emotional nuttiness
and we're going to win and we're going to do this and it was like yes and then
you I find you
standing in front of not fans with hats on that match your campaign
but undecided voters talking about the Middle East and Ukraine and economic policy and that is I mean really I hate this metaphor but I am a fifth generation Texan my Grandpa would say damn girl you brought you brought you brought a knife to a gunfight like you're talking about you're talking you're actually talking about what's going to in my opinion and I'm not being
overwrought
you're talking about the things that I believe could keep my children alive
you're talking about how it's going to work and I'm going to tell you something we are going to win
it is not going to be easy
we are going to win
I believe
that the majority of Americans
not only love our country deeply I believe that right but understand
but at the end of the day
the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on how you beat down is based on who you lift
that's what we teach our kids
it's what we want in leaders in terms of how they look at us and think about us
and you know I talked about it on the campaign Trail because I truly believe people are exhausted with the Trump ER
that no matter what the difference is between us
we know that it is not healthy and it does not strengthen us as a nation to have Americans pointing their fingers at each other no right
it's not only is it exhausting it is
is debilitating and it's somewhat traumatizing to track that level of emotionality in rhetoric especially
is there in the study of power we talked about power over versus Power with and power 2 and in the type of leadership you're talking about is power within two
the problem with power over there's a lot of problems with it but the biggest the biggest thing I've seen of the past 20 years in my career
is to maintain power over
you have to be willing to exercise occasional cruelty against vulnerable populations otherwise you don't lose that fear that power over
depends on
it is demeaning but it is all it's traumatizing in what we know and you know you're the expert at this table
traum
it numbs the individual it numbs the people and when we are numb we will not achieve our capacity
not to mention we will not achieve not only our capacity in terms of productivity
but in terms of a quality of life I mean
I think about it and I think it is an important thing to think about you know what what brings you Joy
think of it this way if you've ever tried to talk with someone who's depressed
and you try to literally and figuratively open the curtains and say look at the Sun
it's a beautiful day and they can't see it
there is something about trauma that is very similar in terms of it blunts our senses and ability to see
The Good the things that will bring joy it's not healthy
and so we have to to your point diagnose it and we have to treat it and one of the ways to treat It ultimately
is not only to deal with the symptoms but deal with the cause
that's what I'm trying to do
I want to talk to you about this because I think this is interesting
one of the emotional polls that my friends I've talked to a lot of people preparing for the interview some you know cuz that's what I do but like just the research and
undecided
some voting for you
I want to
talk about
the emotional pornography that's being used and the false narratives so
part of the narrative that's really being used I think buy some extremists and not all
I I don't know how to say out loud
when you think you're the party or the people who own toughness
God patriotism responsible gun ownership and family than anyone who disagrees with you
is not patriotic that's interesting hates God
is we cannot tough and what is crazy about that is
at the Democratic National Convention
when I I saw this still photo of you
below you were people holding signs that say we fight when we win
and I was like this is one of the first people in my party
to acknowledge that we have to fight to win
you're not afraid of owning the fact that sometimes winning takes fighting absolutely and here's how I think about that if you know what you stand for it then you know what to fight for
stop fighting for the sake of fight
say that again if you know what you stand for you know what to fight for
I stand for
the freedom of women to make decisions about their own body
I stand for the fact that we should
treat each other with dignity and respect by stand for the proposition that we need to lift up working people and give them access to opportunity these are the kinds of things I stand for so I fight for them
and if you look at the history I think of our party
the expansion of Liberty and Justice the protection of people in the values we hold dear you know we are tough as nails so
I love the fact that
Unapologetic
seeing how much the walls children adore their dad I know and it was beautiful and I thought for a moment
Carl Jung said that paradox
disability to hold seemingly contradictory things
is the most important spiritual gift we have and the closest thing that captures the truth to Being Human and when I saw you fight to win and I saw the Walls family what I thought is
these are not different things these are born of the courage to love and the courage to lead you're absolutely right
and you hit it on the head because
it is not only if you know what to stand for you know what to fight for if you love
and I know this is going to sound corny but I love our country
you really do I do I can tell I do and I I believe in the promise of America I am empirical evidence of the promise of America
I know what we can do I know what I believe in the foundational principles and maybe that's being trained as a lawyer and one of the reasons I wanted to become a lawyer
I believe that we can make true all of those words we spoke about our commitment to equality to Liberty to Justice I believe in all that
but none of it will come without us being vigilant
when a democracy is intact what it does to protect the rights and the freedoms in the Liberties of its people
Incredible strength
on the other hand
incredibly fragile there's a fragility
it will only be as strong as our willingness to fight
I want to say something else about in this kind of like fake narratives that are just not true and emotionally resonant for people but untrue
party gets God like I love God I mean I taught Vacation Bible School there is no long-term evaluation of how those kids are doing or whether they're you know I'll still okay but like I love God and if you measure your faith and your commitment to the sacred not
buy Proclamation I'm with you I'm so with you but by the willingness to protect the most vulnerable Among Us
faith in your works oh my God I was just going to say that
care how much you say you love God I'm so with you and I have never
I have as an elect
person
purposely not
a lot because I just find that the people who do tend to be Hypocrites oh yeah and
I was raised in the black church
I was raised to believe in a loving God
and the God that I believe in and pray to is a God that says
Justice have mercy
it is about do good it is about feed the hungry
it is about care for the poor and the Elder
it is about love thy neighbor it is about the Good Samaritan who in the face I mean that's one of my favorite the parable of the Good Samaritan which is you know my way of talking about it is
we should in the face of a stranger see a neighbor
getting back to what I saw in terms of the relief centers after Hurricane Helene that's it that is doing the work
of living your face
I like to say faith is a verb
for
because it is about it is about knowing something even when you can't see it but it is also about the manifesting
and and then making it real and so then that's when you see faith and you have faith right when you see it in the works and the Deeds
as an expression
of your deeply held beliefs yes I mean yes and just for the record this is for me don't quote her quote me you don't get God
and it's just not what we're talking about and I feel like I feel I have to tell you I feel the same way
about the co-opting of patriotism yeah I agree like you know I think patriotism is
protest disagreement debate
and it is the highest form of patriotism I believed to fight for the ideals of our country
that's exactly right
so in this election
fighting
fighting for the fact that we will have a president who does not aspire to be a dictator
admiring people like the president of Russia
we will have in our leaders those who
to uphold and protect the Constitution of the United States not terminated
isn't that aren't those those examples of what we believe patriotism to be which is the love of our country understanding the oath and the responsibility in particular that elected leaders have to foundational principles

this episode is brought to you by JCPenney the holiday season is here and at JCPenney everybody gets more like for your loved one designer perfumes from Versace or Carolina Herrera or the exclusive messy fragrance for the food in your life a cast iron Dutch oven or Keurig coffee maker or for the kids all the toys they love from Disney Barbie Lego and more JCPenney Make It Count shopping store or online
I have to read this to you because when I read this I heard about on the news but when I read the National Security leaders for America letter
so I do a ton of work with the military and with veterans I know some of the people who signed this letter these these people are not kidding around and they're not political people they're not political people and if they were I would imagine they were probably conservative Republicans to be honest with you I agree with you yeah and so
we are former public servants this is on September 22nd 2024 we are former public servants who swore an oath to the Constitution many of us risked our lives for it we are retired generals Admirals senior non-commissioned officers ambassadors and Senior civilian National Security leaders we are Republicans Democrats and independents we are loyal to the ideals of our nation like Freedom democracy and the rule of law not to any individual or party we do not agree on everything but we all adhere to two fundamental principles first we believe in America's national security requires a serious and capable of Commander in Chief
second We Believe American democracy is invaluable each generation has a responsibility to defend
that is why we the undersigned proudly endorse Kamala Harris to be the next president of the United States
does election is a choice between serious leadership and vengeful impulsiveness it is a choice between democracy and authoritarianism
vice president Harris defends America's democratic ideals
wall former president Donald Trump endangers them
I as vice president United States I have now met over 150 world leaders
presidents prime minister's chancellors and Kings many of them multiple times were on a first name basis
when we walk in those rooms around the world representing the United States of America
we have traditionally been able to walk in those rooms chin up shoulders
with the earned and self-appointed authority to talk about things like democracy and rule of law that's
stop being a role
means people watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say and look for one opportunity to dismiss what otherwise and perfect though we may be is a gold standard if not the gold standard and I will tell you that part of my
hope and prayer
for us as a country is that
among the states that we understand are at Planet selection that that we all understand how important America is to the rest of the world
I really
I hope and I pray we fully understand
what we mean to the rest of the world
where were people in various parts of the world are fighting for democracy where women are fighting for
their ability to
be educated to have rights
do you know these National Security leaders having their support and endorsement I'm deeply honored
but it also is Testament to the fact that just like John Kelly recently speaking out publicly about his concerns about Trump and
fascism and all of that
think of their letter as a 911 call to the American people
it took my breath away
they talked about your steadfastness in the situation room they talked about your toughness
and they talked with Will fear about what would happen
that Trump would remain absolutely unchecked
and has developed relationships far deeper than what we understand with some of the most dangerous people threatening everything we believe in and this is not 2016 or 2020 he is also increasingly unstable and unhinged
the significance of even the words that you read about
you know I asked people to imagine we can all picture the Oval Office you've seen it on TV
imagine the Oval Office in your head just imagine
on January
of 2025
if Donald Trump is sitting there
he will be stewing over his enemies list
what I intend to do which is sitting there thinking of the American people working on my to do list
is a big difference
I mean this is goes back to the difference of
loyalists to serve him that's right and come closer yes that's right
I cannot let you out of this conversation without
saying that
I'm really scared for the women in my state
I'm scared for my daughter
I spoke Monday in San Antonio to 7500 Educators and I want to tell you something that really
was devastating to me on stage I was asked by the person facilitating the conversation
what I thought about the fact that some of their members these Educators did not come
because it was being held in San Antonio
and they would not come because of the Machiavellian abortion laws here
and I thought well I believe in staying up for what you believe in and as it turns out
I can barely talk about it I
as it turns out many of the women who chose not to come
pregnant women who do not want to travel to states with Trump abortion bands for exactly that reason that God forbid something happens God forbid they are experiencing a difficulty with their pregnancy or miscarriages and absolutely all of a sudden their choices are go to jail or die
again this gets back to
the fact that we must be vigilant and we have to remember that
we can never take our rights for granted
back to your point about talking with folks about
whether they should get very activated around this election and knock on doors and tell people why they care and why it matters and why they should vote
this is the day this is the time this is because this is this is and I mean
the fundamental
the knot
that in the United States of America in this year of Our Lord 2024
that women don't have the right to make decisions about their own body I mean what could be more fundamental we're not talking about property rights we're literally talking about
the right to make decisions about your own body
an in Texas
the law provides up to prison for life for a physician a healthcare provider for performing the care that they deem in the best interests of their patient and can you imagine
what's happening now is that I've talked to a lot of Physicians and medical school professors
and they're seeing a decline
in the post office for she want to go into family or going to Family Medicine particular reproductive Health Care
because these students are there they don't want to go to States
abortion bands
and you already look at the fact that
we still have the the sad reality of America's we still have the highest rate of maternal mortality of any so-called wealthy Nation if you look at the reasons behind that it includes the lack of appropriate and adequate care for women
in the context of their reproductive systems whether it be pre-pregnancy during pregnancy
we have so many deserts we call them deserts for maternal care oh
and you have then the effect that includes that people don't want to go into reproductive health care I'm the first vice president and never has there been a president who has gone to a reproductive Health Clinic I wanted to go because I wanted to highlight the fact that in these clinics also it's not only abortion care
did your breast cancer screenings
a Planned Parenthood nurse practitioner for 15 years exactly right and because you knew and so many people know you walk into that clinic and that's where you're going to be treated with dignity you're not going to be judged it's a safe place that's what these clinics offer usually they are run by women
and they're closing
in many places because of the laws that are present in those States so you're talking about
so many ramifications whether it be students going into to Medical practice for Reproductive care whether it be clinics closing whether it be pregnant women not wanting to travel whether it be kids like some of my God children who in high school are making college application decisions based on which state
the ramifications of this highlight a fact which is that Donald Trump threw his decision to put those three members on the Supreme Court to undo
has created a healthcare crisis in America this is a healthcare crisis this is a healthcare crisis for sure
okay our
is up
I'm getting up I'm getting a sign we can keep going but I know like I could sit here and talk to you all afternoon yeah I'm going to end with something that we always end up with it which is part of the rapid fire just one question
a snapshot of an ordinary moment in your life that gives you true Joy Sunday family dinner
hands
in in my normal life
I love to cook and Sunday family dinner is non-negotiable
everyone comes whoever's in town they can bring their friends and I cook we have our routines
Sunday family dinner hands
we have a big Sunday family dinner I will say the snapshot of an ordinary moment in my life that gives me true Joy is
and your commitment to Justice and your commitment to duty and service
and I am as activated as I can be and I can't thank you for your voice I said it to you before we started the program but
you give voice to so many people who
rightly must be seen and heard and talk about
leadership what you do with your voice and your platform is really built community in a very important way and I thank you for that cuz that's in the best interest of all of us so thank you and it's great to be with you I look forward to talking with you again I do too
I really appreciate you all being here for the conversation
learn the lot
about
I guess I was surprised in some ways I don't know why about her values it completely checks out
that fairness and justice
are the deep deep core values that she turns to when things are tough
we all have many values but there's normally we have found in our research one or two that is the space where all other values are forged and it means something to me to have a leader of this democracy that's committed to
Justice and fairness
that's committed to building a collaborative high-performing strategic leadership team around her rather than a team of loyalists that don't serve the country but sir
the
I think in any other sector where you and I would be at work or a non-profits wherever we go every day the team of loyals
has never gone down
in global history
as courageous meaningful leadership
I hope you vote
I hope you take seriously
the
oath that maybe we have not taken because we are not formal elected leaders but the oath that we all take as Citizens in a democracy
I'm grateful for you I'm grateful for this community
