Stephen Colbert hi Stephen
this is something we do when we're on break and unfortunately we are on break this week we love doing the shows occasionally we do need to bathe yes and we come here on the podcast and we do some introductions to some favorite
pieces from the show so that the Pod show listeners have something to chew on while we're away and Steven I want to like the idea that are reruns of our old shows on podcasts are a form of entertainment jerky exactly exactly before we get started here before we go into today's podcast I have a work thing I have a quick work thing and I thought this would be a unique opportunity to give the people of the listeners of The Late Show podcast
select me hi Becca Tom wants you to ask Stephen if he wants grilled onions on his
yes yes would you also tell Keira to tell Tom that Colbert kids questions is ready for tonight yes okay there it is you just saw
that that you're
your business insiders now yes you understand show business so grilled onions on the brat any mustard
a little must
on the
you heard it here first this is how the sausage gets made literally
he's going to be eating his host on the show tonight potentially you want to tell them why
I assume I don't know I haven't actually read this joke but I assume it has to do with Charlie XCX brat summer
the summer so far has been really good I think about the highlight of the summer was probably going to North Carolina with my boys and doing some fly fishing with Woody
used to be the guitarist for the Steep Canyon Rangers now he's got his own bluegrass
miles from around Brevard North Carolina
and he's been on the show a few times playing with Steve Martin when he comes on to play you know what his his his his blue
during covid cuz he couldn't tour so we started
a guide again like you did when he was young
and nothing
you know nothing is not a young man still
Woody I know you're just you're full of them and
but my boys and I went there we fished all day and then drink
fairly large amount of whis
and played Bluegrass with him and some of his friends you know banjo mandolin and Fiddle it was fantastic wow beautiful and you know the news the news is pretty exciting not exactly a slow news Because by the time this actually gets broadcast everything could have changed that's true too fast yeah you know
the acceleration of the new cycle is is getting a dizzying I thought things were fast during the Trump years
just the last two weeks are absolutely
mind-boggling which brings us to our podcast today which I'll give you a hint that the subject of a podcast today
is recently announced a new campaign for president from 2019 she's been on the show six times during covid is this the first time this is the third this is when she had just announced her first presidential run and she was on the Senate intelligence committee talking about investigations over Trump
but it's great interview she's really it's a really strong interview of hers and I thought
let's play Let's listen let's listen to the new to the to the
she has the requisite number of delegates but they
cast their votes yet in that Zoom convention they're going to have on August
7th I don't know yeah I don't know
I would recommend everybody go out and watch on The Late Show
YouTube page watch Kamala Harris mood mix
it's really good she named her favorite songs for different o
including the presidential pop
what she chooses One Nation Under a Groove by Parliament it's pretty great yeah yeah check that out on the YouTube page
all right well this is Kamala Harris on The Late Show podcast enjoy welcome from
what is different about
everything and nothing has changed everything has changed in terms of just
you know time on the road and level of scrutiny level of scrutiny level of sleep
you know I always say that in campaign
give me the Angels walking Among Us you know you meet people that you might if we lived a thousand years maybe we can
these folks who are just doing incredible work in their communities without any expectation of fame or or noticed just you know I met a woman in South Carolina there's a street there called lady Street you know be your friend a lady Street okay and every Merchant with the exception of one is a woman
and I meet this one woman
and she has a vintage clothing
why well because she grew up in foster
she then you know made an incredible success out of herself and she had never until then worn clothes
so she decided to have this vintage Store where the proceeds go to young women in the community who are going for job interviews for the first time or going to work and they don't have suits
incredible incredible kind of people tell him today there's a Donald Trump said he won't work with Dems until all investigations
you're on the Senate intelligence committee
are you going to end
are you guys going to end the investigation OK Google
right over the issue of the investigation
so let me just tell you again traveling the country
Steven almost half of American families are $400 unexpected expense away from complete upheaval write $400 unexpectedness could be the car breaks down on hospital bill you didn't see coming do you know how much it cost to get four tires in America these days on average about 400.00 why do people need new tires because the roads are falling apart so when we talked about the if you want to talk about a representative government supposed to self-interest
North Carolina he issued a subpoena
for Don Jr which surprise a lot of people because not a lot of Republicans have
a spine and he and and they worked a deal with Don's going to come in right to come in you guys are going to talk to him behind closed doors and limited time or something like that
you know what it's not closed doors here what would you like to ask him can you let us know some of the things you'd like to ask Don junior is going to want to know is
when he took that meeting one why didn't he walk out when it became clear that there was a foreign adversary who was trying to manipulate and interfere in the election of the president of the United States because I can answer that one because he knew it was a foreign adversary giving dirt on opponent from the email before he ever went in he walked in knowing what it was and so the question becomes then
who did
what about Trump Tower because he testified that I didn't really know I didn't really know we need to know all of that and I agree with you we need to know all of that I think you're going to get answers
Bob Marley gave us answers
there are in that report at least 10 specific incidents where we know that there was obstruction of justice it is my firm belief
that the only reason he did not return an indictment is because of that office of legal counsel opinion and it's an opinion not the law and opinion right and he said that and I think that well on this subject we should do is rely on those almost 1
former members of the United States Department of Justice who have essentially said but for that memo that opinion and indictment would have been returned that the evidence here is sufficient to sustain an indictment are you guys going to talk to Mueller I hope that we can get in front of us but you know what even if he does not come in front of us there is sufficient basis there is a sufficient basis to know that there is enough there to return an indictment but for that office of legal councils opinion what do you think of Chairman's leadership so far
you know I think that I serve on many committees I'm on Judiciary I'm on intelligence Homeland Security and budget of all the Committees and frankly of all of the open conversations I've had since I've been in the Sin
demos bipartisan thus far is the work that happens in the Senate intelligence committee and frankly I think part of the reason is that
when we get in that SK
what is the name of the very tightly sealed and closed-door room
you know people take off their jackets and have real conversations about National Security in a way that always should occur in a non-partisan
so that has been so that has been the way that it has worked so far and it is my hope that it will continue to be non-partisan in the way we conduct ourselves what we have to take a little bit of a break but don't go away we'll be right back with more of Senator Kamala Harris
we're here with us presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris now know Nancy Pelosi speaker Pelosi says Trump's obstruction
could be impeachable
I believe that charges impeachment should be brought against the president I believe that the process should begin to do an investigation to determine ultimately whether impeachment should happen is there a difference between that and the investigations that are going on now
initiating a process toward impeachment where they would then at the end produce findings with a recommendation and if they recommend that then they're being impeachment proceeding obviously they'll send it over to the
I have called and do believe that that process should begin I think there's a very good reason to do it and I agree with Nancy plus the statement today
I will also say that it is also fair that we we are realistic that the Senate is not going to
we don't we don't control the majority and I have no reason to believe and there's been no evidence that on the Senate side that they're going to actually do the right thing and so extra power that comes with starting an impeachment inquiry in other words is are the requests for information is peanuts are they are they less deniable by the president if an impeachment query like what is the value of then starting the impeachment of the value is
is is is is preserving the the the the the the the this construct of our democracy that the founders imagine which is that we have three independent co-equal branches of government where there should be checks and balances and the United States Congress hasn't responsibility conduct itself to conduct itself in a way that we we pursue these inquiries and determine if this president has in fact obstructed Justice and violated the law so it's about maintaining the Integrity of our democracy and the design of it but I will say that being said we should fight for that and fight for the value of the construct and our democracy
but the reality also is that at the end of this the Senate probably will not vote to impeach him and which means that he'll probably prance around and say Sea Witch Hunt Witch Hunt they went after me and they didn't get me and so we have to just also balance right this is a reality I've never imagined him prancing before but thank you for that thank you for that image of this week
are your equal pay plan what's the plan because what's the plan because I remember Obama on day one signed the Lily Ledbetter act what did not get accomplished by that the equal pay plan would cover it so it was extraordinary progress the President Obama together with Lily better herself made in and it was a historic and what he did and all so it was the first bill he signed so really was a strong statement
and I want to take it to the next step and this is
when women are they are required with the law says that women and men should be paid equally for equal work
but what we know is that in America today women on average are paid 80 cents on the dollar
what men are paid for the same work African-American women 61 cents on the dollar Latinas 53 cents on the dollar so and these are actually not debatable points this is not hours worked on average over a work week this is our for
annual salary but it's for the same work what are people being paid and so what I am saying is this instead of requiring that woman
let's say she's hanging out at the water cooler during
talking to her male colleague who works in the cubicle next to her doing the same work she does and he starts talking about what he got his kids for Christmas and it is clear to her that he's making more money than she is right what is she going to do well she's not going to ask him how much is he getting paid and he probably won't tell her she'll probably go to a supervisor hey
how are we getting paid and the supervisor probably say something like I can't tell you about Sal
so she's sniffing around she kind of has a sense of it but she has no access to information so maybe she goes and she files a complaint with the EEOC right
and then she's going to have to then go a lot through a long process her colleagues will probably find out about it she will probably receive the wrath of her colleagues and maybe it goes nowhere with that complaint maybe she has to come out of pocket to hire a lawyer to sue
to get equal pay what I'm saying is instead of her having to go through that process let's put the onus on the corporations to prove their paying people equally and and shift the burden from her to the corporation and in my opinion good business is about good business if you are conducting the business in a way that you are proud
then you should be able to tell us if you're paying people equally and I'm also requiring that they will have to post on their website
what do they have been certified by the EEOC as paying people equally or not so you know like you a restaurant the senator thank you so much for being here comma thank you for listening to The Late Show podcast show with Stephen Colbert just one more thing if you want to see more of me come to The Late Show YouTube channel for more Clips exclusives OK Google
