which President is great to see you and we're now in the 8th year of the political persecution the president Donald J Trump
you are taking incoming everyday from the legal system the Marxism
give us a sense of how you feel right now
in what your senses of this country that will permit such an outbreak
so I don't think there's ever been a time like this I think we're very close to
being at the end of our country as we know it a great country it's Marx's it's fascist it's communist it's what they're doing is incredible what they've done with weaponization of doj FBI and others
all sort of reporting up
if it's a local de or Attorney General Estate Attorney General
I think it's a very dangerous time
the hope is 2024 because if we went we're going to get that straightened out so fast
cuz it's all
it's the people from the top it's a very dangerous time for our country I really believe that then we have the wall where millions and millions of people are pouring into our country we have
are the most incompetent president we've ever had has no idea what's going on in the world has no respect from the world
and numerous countries are coming up with nuclear weapons which is the real global warming threat
the ocean will rise over the next 400 years
and I think the countries in trouble I think it's the most dangerous time in the history of our country
and a lot of that is weaponization but a lot of that is a real lot of that is nuclear weapons I think
we we were respected with me we
tremendous control of things Iran was behaving because they
didn't have the money now they have tremendous money I mean they were broke
now they have tremendous money they've gained in the last 3 years
hundreds of billions of dollars of
I told China that if you buy you're not going to do business with the United States I told India I told her that do you buy you do no business with the United States
and we were dealing with Iran and it was fine we was actually very good if you remember
there was no money going to Hamas there was no money going to Hezbollah there were stories about it because they didn't have any money
now they
billions and billions of dollars probably 127 billion not including
the six billion dollars that you read about for the hostage
another great deal 6 million for the hostages so
I think the countries in the greatest dangerous ever been
add to a large extent of big portion of that would be because we have a leader that
doesn't know what to do
you you say that this President is weak you say that he is the the issue
and so many people in the National left wing corporate
we're talking about why the rest of the world is not respect
there is no policy that he has offered up that I perceive at least as being pro-america the the policies are Marxist in in nearly every respect
whether it is to do it has to do with the American Family whether it has to do with sovereignty border security illegal immigration foreign policy you had created a modest foreign policy
bringing home our troops with drawing troops from foreign lands and about 100 of them we have troops now
how does that make you feel to see that reverse of your policies that you know that we're creating such a great response on the part of the global global Nations so I was bringing them home but also bringing them home from countries that don't even like us where we're protecting countries that took advantage of us and hate us in many cases
when you look at Afghanistan the withdrawal that was a big moment
because I believe it was the most incompetent and embarrassing time in the history of our country
the way we withdrew not that was wrong cuz I was withdrawing too but we were going to do it with great strength and dignity
I believe that the withdrawal from Afghanistan the way they did it leaving 85 billion dollars worth of equipment 85 billion
behind the best equipment in the world leaving it behind you know I don't know if you know this that the Taliban and
Afghanistan
Afghanistan now is one of the top three traders in military equipment that sell cuz they don't need 70000 guns and rifles they don't need 70,000 Vehicles many of them are played if they don't need tanks and all of the things that we left we left behind 85 billion dollars worth of equipment the best military equipment in the world but most importantly 13
soldier's
38 soldiers horribly wounded and hundreds of people kill
and it should have been nothing and we took the soldiers out we took our military out before we
are American hostages are you have people over there you have still hundreds of Americans over there haven't been able to get out
we should have taken everything out and then you take it you could ask a child
when would you take the military at 5 years old he'd say you take the military at last we took the military out first
so we were going to get out with dignity and strength and we lost background bugger and was one of the biggest airfields in the world
and most importantly not because of Afghanistan but because of China it's 1 hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons
and to have that would have been incredible I was never leaving that we're going to keep that
I think it was the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country and Putin would have never gone into Ukraine anyway but when he saw that
he said this is the time to move because these people are in confident
and as you know president she's talking about Taiwan
and lots of things are we just were not respected at all and 3 years ago we were greatly respected and 3 years ago we were energy independent
and you had gasoline selling for less than $2
and now you have it at 567 and even $8
a
what's happened to our country
truly one of the worst things is when you have millions and millions I know this I've been your friend and I've been your your Watcher I would watch you all the time and I still do it whenever I can
but I know you very well it must just drive you crazy when you see millions of people coming into our country
totally unchecked from jails from mental institutions terrorists
we're going to be paying a big price we're going to do big deportation by the way which will make you feel slightly better
but they're coming in from the prisons all over the world to me this isn't just in South America
all over Africa
in the Congo
the other day people released from prisons in the Congo
in fact some of these people make our prisoners look like very nice people
we have people in our country now
that shouldn't be in our country
millions of people are being
a walking just just walking through our country right now as we speak they have the largest Caravan of people and they might come up with
and we stopped the Caravans pretty quickly
what day the largest Caravan anyone seen and it's pouring in through Mexico heading up to our country
10 million an estimated 10 million illegal immigrants just since Joe Biden took the Oval Office
that is extraordinary by any meas
yet there is no discussion of amongst the business Elites the global business Elites no discussion from social critics and Academia are universities and colleges nor are trading partners and and Military Allies it is extraordinary development that no one could have imagined an American president inviting which is exactly what this presidential
they say and I built a wall I built 561 Mi of wall which is a big thing you know they said oh it's 50 well it's not 50 but they say what's 50
no it's way over 500 is 561 and we had another 200 ready to go we actually built it
and all we had to do is install it could have been up in about 3 weeks
and they wouldn't put it up that's when I realized I actually wanted open borders but the wall was great and we also had Mexico paying for their soldiers and we had 28,000 Mexican soldiers on our border
and they paid for it free of charge it was nice
not easy to get I had to say things that you know you don't want to really say like we're going to tear off your product if you don't put them there
so we had the best numbers we've ever had and now we have the worst numbers I think that any countries ever had I don't think any country has ever had numbers like this I don't care if it's third world or not
we have the worst numbers we've ever had
3 years ago we had the best numbers we've ever had and that included not only
people coming in and included drugs human trafficking we had the best numbers in everything almost every category that we've ever had
the dire circumstances that this country faces of fentanyl 100,000 deaths a year
child trafficking Health and Human Services can't find can't track over 80,000 children across that border China is a partner with Mexico and their drug cartels and they are responsible for Fentanyl and it's coming from Mexico and this president
on Wednesday will be talking with you in pain about a new relationship with a with a power that is expansionary that is threatening the United States almost every month
your reaction
well the other thing is remember that until I get indicted I've been indicted more than Al Capone over
complaining about a rigged election
over things that nobody can even believe you read even these legal Scholars they can't even believe so they've weaponized the doj but remember this Biden
got money from China he got money from Ukraine they got money from many of these countries but he got millions of dollars from China
and that's what they found now they find that and it seems very conclusive obviously but if they find that how much money didn't they find because it's not easy to find and I think I think they have him over a barrel frankly because nobody can be so weak
was Chyna what they're doing you know I took him billions hundreds of billions of dollars from China hundreds of billions of dollars
I gave our Farmers 28 billion dollars because
excuse me the language but they were screwed by China for many years
and I went to Sonny Perdue secretary of agriculture
how much is it they said 28 billion I took it out of the tariffs I gave it to the farm
but I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China no president ever took in 10 cents it was a one-way deal
and I change things around a lot of people think that's why we had the China virus frankly because they never had a problem like they
with me but I don't think so I think it was gross incompetence at the Wuhan lab that's what I think I really don't believe you know there are those people that said they wanted they would have done anything to get rid of me
I actually had a very good relationship with President sheet but once once the China virus or covid came along it was it was a lot different
but it's so sad to see what's happened to our country in a short period of time
inflation at a level that we haven't seen in 70 years
you look at what's going on with energy it's just you look at the lack of respect they have for us
but you just take a look at the lack of respect
the way China talks about our country now they would never have said that with me
in fact they had
policy 2425 I guess it was 202
and I said you know I'd appreciate if you take that down because that's very insulting in other words that was going to be when they really take over everything
economically you heard that right China 2025
insulting statement because you're really saying you're going to take over
in 2025 and I know you're going to try but we're going to try to have
us keep
and he took everything down but now I see that using everything was taken it was all got one conversation was all
you know it's pretty pretty sad to say you are you shut down the trans-pacific partnership involving all of the Pacific powers and Indochina as well
Administration and it's and its supporters in Corporate America trying to restore a TPP and what's your reaction to that after you had killed the original which would yeah we lost about 50% of our auto manufacturing between Canada and Mexico China all over the place
if you look at Mexico the number of automobiles that make its incredible the factories the size of the buildings they're building to make cars not during my
but they came in and they just decimated or auto business and the manufacturing that's why the other workers how could they ever
vote for the
and this guy was a part of it what other countries have done to us
and now with this all electric mandate all of those cars are going to be made in China they're not going to be made here they're going to be made in China
the all electric car they don't go far and they cost too much you know it's very simple somebody said well
should we make it more complex you don't have to they don't go far
and they cost too much if you want to take a very short trip it's nice
but if you want to go like Beyond
the state line without having to get a charge for two and a half hours it's so crazy what they're doing
they're destroying our country
they're destroying the country I think a lot of people have that sense and know about half the population has that sense and there are people in this country a lot of people good strong
families that are fighting against these policies and their effects on Middle America
you were the president who made the Republican Party The Party of the working man and woman in this country the American family
give us your sense of what you will do
to restore Primacy
add to the Forgotten men and women of this country right now are fighting for their economic and they're real survival so let me just say one thing that happened so the Keystone XL pipeline it was
being
it was moving along it was a massive project going all the way down to the ghoul
it was a great project 48,000 workers he came in the first day he ended
and by the way the head of that Union the pipeline Union have a
people that build pipelines have a union the head of IT endorsed bid
now the workers I guarantee they mostly voted for me
but the indoors and then as soon as he comes in
get rid of all those jobs
and all of the importance of that pipeline it was such an important thing but that's just one of so many different things so what will be doing is will be drilling
will be reducing energy that will bring down inflation that will bring down interest rates if you want to buy a home today you're middle income and you want to go out to a bank the Bank's number one don't have money
and they do have money they're loaning it at 9:00 and 10:00 and 11:00 or not loaning it really at all
we have
an economy that's incredible we have an economy that's so fragile and the only reason it's running now is it's running off the fumes of what we did what the Trump it's just running off the fumes
and when does the crash I hope it's going to be
during this next 12 months
because I don't want to be Herbert Hoover the one president I just don't want to be Herbert Hoover
but what they've done is incredible
what they're doing
with all of this money the trillions and trillions of dollars
of waste this green New Deal is you know it's a the green New Deal
will destroy our country and I'm an environmentalist more than they are
but when you see the kind of money that they're throwing around
on building
infrastructure that's no good
what environmentally friendly when doing windmills all over the place that
the most by the way the most expensive energy in the world you cannot get more expensive
and now you notice it's all coming down because they're not working it's not working economically it doesn't work
20 times more expensive than what we have under our feet Liquid Gold I call it Liquid Gold we have more than any other country
and we'll be using it and will be selling it to Europe and will be doing a lot of things with it we were going to sell
massive amounts of oil and gas to
they wouldn't have even needed
and we're going to make a fortune we're going to start paying down debt we owe 34 trillion dollars we're going to start paying down debt everything was going great in fact I was all set to do that and then we got hit with covid we had
worried about that
and we did a great job with that but we never got the credit for that one I got a credit for a great account we had the greatest economy in the history of our country
and I got credit for that but never for the job you know we
just came in from China but even they tried to this day they tried to say it wasn't China but it was China it was the Wuhan Labs which I said right from the beginning
but we were going to pay down debt we're going to reduce taxes for the we gave the largest tax cut in history
and we're going to pay down debt for
and we were doing a great job and then we had a very unfortunate
election
I know who you're involved with so I can say it here but sometimes I say you'll cut it out so you know why what's the purpose but we had to rig the election that's what I'm saying that's why I say it with you
we had a recollection it was rigged 100%
and the question I get most is
number one how do you take it and I take it I guess cuz genetically I take it
I think I also take it cuz we're doing so well we're leaving Everybody by so much so that helps
but the other question I get the most probably number two maybe number one sometimes
is
how do we stop them from cheating people ask
will they do it again
cuz you know I'm in Florida now and I drive to various locations in airports and places every house has a trump sign on Trump 2024
we got all the votes
the risk is what's going to happen during election period used to be election day
or election night that's the election
but today you don't have that you have 60 days 40 days 30 days
give some states where they have
8 days to count the vote after the election is over
how do you have an election when you have to count the vote
and you know the machines are supposed to speed up the process right
where to go to wallpaper
wallpaper you know they have no watermark paper it's incredible what you can do with paper but we will wallpaper same day voting and voter ID little thing like voter ID
the Democrats are violently against voter ID because it will make it very hard for them to can you imagine somebody saying we don't want voter ID
re-litigate 20/20
the factors of this country doesn't come to its senses about how
deceitful and crooked these elections are and I'm talking about from the local to the presidential offices
we're going to have real problems but I don't see from the Republican party is a response I don't see Ronald McDaniel in the NRC I agree with you going after
what do you what would you like to see I know you've got more than a full plate you're being a sale from every quarter
but what would you like to see the Republican party for which you are the titular head
so what I want in 2016
I want I want home and I watch I did my thing I did 7 rally on the final day maybe 7 rows and the two final days 7 and 7:00 and not a lot of people can do that
and they were full big beautiful rally started in Florida ended up in Iowa
when was 82 degrees one was 3 degrees below zero it's called pneumonia weather right that's beautiful because you go from that difference but we did a great thing and I went home and watch her watch the election and I won the election
I never thought I'd have to watch votes you know that's supposed to be done by States really
for the federal government supposed to be done by Saints and we're supposed to have people watching it within the party
and they said they'll never let that happen again and I was hearing those statements I said that's a weird statement right
and they cheated and they cheated at every different level many different ways and we have it all documented we have so much document that is not even even if you didn't want to get into the fact like 2000 meals where they you know you have them on camera stuffing the ballot boxes okay how much and they're all federal cameras you know this is all federal and many of the cameras were missing
but they have hundreds of thousands of votes even at that but don't even get into that
don't get in when you see workers stuffing boxes with cameras Federal cameras
go into the 5
intelligence agents where they said the laptop from Hell which exposed tremendous crime
was a Russian disinformation they don't know it was it was cheating I was cheating
going to all of the different legislators where they didn't get approval to do all this stuff that they
how to get it from the legislators and they didn't if you look at Wisconsin now Wisconsin is essentially admitted that
but you can't do anything after 30 days you know it's really think of it it's sick
they catch your cheating on the election you're not able to you're not able to do anything if you don't catch him in time the Republicans do not fight
the same way they don't fight dirty
and I don't see anybody should fight dirty but you got to fight smart
and they seem not to
you know we have guys like Mitch McConnell it's just like it's hope
watching and I tell them I said don't help me during the next period time don't help me at all during the next year I get all the votes we're getting more votes than
just watch that election period secure the vote really
because they don't secure the boat
if they don't secure the vote bad things can happen now we have some very good people cuz now I'm involved in that who thought you would have had to be involved I thought I'd campaign I go home and I see what happens but I can't paint I went home and then all of a sudden I see it looks like Pennsylvania is going to be ours by a lot
and then at 3:02 or whatever it was in the morning all of a sudden they're finding all sorts of stuff
and look what happened to our country because of it it's a different country this is a different country than it was 3 years ago
it's a country that's no longer respected it's a company that a country
are energy is a disaster think of that we have more than anybody else and we are paying
the highest price is nobody's ever seen anything like it
power energy if we bring that down to where it should be will reduce inflation you have to get it back what they say well we're only at 4% now
what is 4% over the biggest increase in history
so people are being absolutely killed
it's very interesting if you go back and study inflation
inflation is a country Buster
you can go back years ago many years ago in Germany with that big inflation destroyed the country it destroys countries
and it along with many other things are destroying this country but we have so many things
the Border millions and millions of people coming and you can go there's not one thing
in this country now that works that's good I mean you can't say well he's good at this or he's good at
everything is bad
the inflation is horrible that everything is bad there's nothing that you can say well except he did a great job here he didn't do a great job and everything you go through the 10 or 12 major things
every one of them is a disaster
how much of the
I think more than half of the country
Circle want you to be the president elected in 2024
how confident are you
that you can win
and overcome all that you
indictments are there the full array of the federal government against you whether it's the federal get off the phone executive action taken by by President Biden 3 months after he was in office
are he meant to weaponize the government from the very beginning
and you've got a party
that is right now working against itself whether it's in the House of Representatives whether it is a number of lesser known personalities I'll put it that way but even if they should be denominated
I'm up 64 points and having debates
the party should be unified the party should be having the best you know you have a 64 point lead the weaponization is interesting because the people get it
and you know I have a big platform I can talk to people like you I can talk to others
I don't think my numbers would be anywhere near who who would think this is possible think of it you get indicted
on ridiculous stuff
along with other people that were very decent people you see some of the people these are high-quality wonderful people they've been you know they want to destroy these people
but you get indicted
you explain it to the public and
your vote goes up that's never happened before
if you get indicted normally you go to the microphone you announced your retiring
you want to spend more time with your family you know it's a standard phrases that they use and you want to clear your name
my numbers have gone through the roof
because people see it's a hoax just like Russia Russia Russia was a hoax you were the first one to see that you are a small group of people
new the Russia Russia Russia thing was a hoax
and if we had
a strong attorney general instead of Amanda was petrified
he would have done something about it maybe you can still do something about it you know you do have a 6-year statute of limitations
the bar was a coward he didn't have the courage to do what he should have done
when they said they were going to impeach
he became a marshmallow
a big
marshmallow
he became weak he was petrified he didn't want to be a bitch I said I got impeached twice in my numbers went up you remember that I got a picture of my numbers went up so I'm a little inverse from people but he was petrified of doing it now how don't your numbers and how don't you get
in trouble
with the other party
say what you want about
they could keep their Congress nice and easy they always got 100% did you ever see a negative
they always got 100% so they could impeach me and I had 100% of the Republican party but they had a slight majority right in the house
so Nancy Pelosi is a crazy horrible person actually
she impeached me over nothing can teach me where I was right because if you look at the Ukraine thing I turned out to be right the laptop says
prove that Trump was 100% right that should have never been indicted the other should have never been
they indicted me
4 * Al Capone was only indicted Alpha Capone was the greatest of them all in terms of the gangsters right Scarface
he was indicted once I was indicted four times but the good news it's over nothing it's I called the Biden and diamond
what they've done is they will they go after their political opponent
that's a precedent it's like the president of giving 6 billion dollars
Iran for releasing five people
and that's a bad president because now all of a sudden you can see a lot of people missing
I never paid anything you know we let out we got out
58 hostages I never paid 10 cents never
because once you pay
the president's bed the president on doing what they did with the
with using the weaponization using the doj the FBI to go after the political opponent
that is so bad because that means that I can do it too in other words the Pandora's Box is open
and that means that I can do it too and I don't want to do
but they've opened something that's never been opened in this country it's been opened and done in third world countries pretty effectively but it's never a Banana Republic but it's never been done in this country and certainly never like this and the people get it
we have to win in 2024 if we don't win in 2024 we have not got a country anymore I really believe that I know you believe it I know you believe it probably even more strongly than me but if we don't win this is the most important election we've ever had
I used to go around saying 2016 was the most important it was at the time I thought it was the most important cuz we were heading in the wrong direction
it was important but nothing compared to what we have now
if we don't win this election I really believe this country is done
millions and millions of Americans agree with
I believe exactly that myself
I'd like to close on an optimistic note and if you would give us a sense of what you would do
in terms of ending the hostilities the war
between Ukraine and Russia
what you would do to support Israel to make certain that they don't have to live with Terror as every minute of every day of their existence
I have to say
before I even start to give you that answer
which is very doable by the way
but it was a lot better
in the old days when I was there because it would have never happened
Ukraine would have never been invaded
and Russia would not have done that and putting on I had a very good relationship and I have
was olinsky very good relationship
but you remember he was the one that said they're crazy when he when they said did he threaten you
he actually
but I have a relationship with
and I say I will have that settled before I take office
if I win as president-elect I will get that
Bloodbath
and the numbers are much bigger you know the number of people that are dying when you see those buildings coming down all over the place there's a lot of people in those buildings and then you hear two people were injured
two people were sent to the hospital with minor injuries and they drop these massive buildings I'll get Ukraine settled Israel something is going to happen I think probably by the time
we get to office something
either very negative or
positive but I think negative because
we don't have a leader this should have never happened they would have never attacked
Israel that attack that horrible attack which was a horrible attack and the amazing thing is
the people don't talk about the attack anymore they don't talk about that they only talk about the other
add something has to be done it has to be done very quickly
the the problem with that one
is
some really bad things can happen fairly quickly
and that includes other nations getting involved that are pretty big nations with millions of soldiers
and they talk about it openly
they talked about it openly because they have no respect for the United States anymore and they have no respect for the leader of the United States
it's a big problem
but if I get in and I hope I do because I love our country and I never like to say I will win because I think that's foolish to say I think we're going to have a we have a great chance
we have to keep the cheating down to a minimum you can't stop them totally but we have to keep it
down to a
and one of the best ways is we have to swamp them to use a term
the opposite meaning we have to swap we have drain the swamp and then swamping them but you have to we have to swap
because it comes a point where they can't you know it's just too big to cheat
but they will go as high as they can
these are people that
if you think about it
if you have open borders
if you have high gasoline prices
High interest r
you can't buy a home the school system stinks everything is bad
how do you win an election there's only one way you have to
and I've done it for years but nobody ever saw anything like it in 2020
you can't let that go
people that use the term election denier I'm an election than I am I'm an absolute election Den
I wish I didn't have to do that because we should have won that election
but you look at it and the people you have to learn from history
so people forgot that what they did in Atlanta was a terrible thing
you know they never go after the people that cheated
they only go after the people that are looking at the people that
because they don't want the answers and they know the answers I'm going to be releasing something having to do with Georgia very soon
Mass Effect Mass
I'm going to be releasing things on other states I view this as an opportunity other lot of people would say wow
a lot of big
but when you look at even now let's go to a slightly different subject but it's all corrupt we have a very corrupt country
January 6
what's happened to those people is not believable
what's happened
policeman fire
lawyers military pay
what's happened and yet nothing happens on the other side I was watching the other day as a fence was being destroyed at the White House
painted over I built that fence you know it's a titanium fence it's
incredible job we did because of the other was
no longer capable of doing the job that you may have to have
the horror that they were doing to the White House with the spray paint all over the place
hor
nothing's going to happen to those people nothing will happen to them
but you go to j6 and you see little thing came out a couple of months ago that they have destroyed all the evidence you know that they've destroyed
they've taken that hearing which was a total sham
with
Democrats
and two Republicans that were far worse than any Democrat that ever lived okay two very sick people I mean this is a sick person
I was responsible for her defeat in her state
where she couldn't be beaten them by the time we finish she got the lowest vote in the history of politics for sitting Congressman Los
cuz most of them went to that low they just resigned before they go through an election
when you see what they did they got rid of all of the
Stephanie Ann
we have deleted
and essentially thrown out they threw out everything almost everything I guess maybe they saved a couple of good things for them they threw out all the statements about Nancy Pelosi and not wanting the soldiers she would have done that you wouldn't have had a j
they threw out all of the statements made by the police chief about Nancy Pelosi and about others
and then I believe he died
there was a lot of bad things
how about me grabbing a secret service agent who is Young and very strong
being slightly rebuffed can I go to the one on the other side of the car
can I grab them around the neck actually a lot of people said I didn't know you were that strong you know one of them was like a black belt or
they said that was impressive
it's not impressive such a lie you know I mean this stuff was made
they got rid of everything they got rid of just about all it was thrown out
soak
have a country that's lost its way we have a failing Nation
and we're going to turn it around we have to win in 2024 we cannot
allow anybody else there they don't have the votes the only way they can win is to
and again their policies it's not possible that that
30% of the people want to have open borders where people with criminals are allowed to come into our country and do terrible things to them and everyone else is not possible
they have the worst policy
it's not even believable policy
including their stuff which is going to destroy our country it's going to destroy our country
but and nobody's more important nobody loves you and I want clean air I want clean water Crystal Clean I want everything but
if we don't win the election in 2024 I really believe that America is finished if we do I think we can bring it back to a level greater than ever before
