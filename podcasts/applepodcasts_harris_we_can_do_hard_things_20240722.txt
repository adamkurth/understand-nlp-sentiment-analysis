hey y'all
wow what a couple of days huh
yesterday
President Biden announced that for the good of the nation
he would not remain in the race for the presidency
and instead he offered his full support and endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic nominee for president
he said in his announcement that choosing her as VP was his first and best deck
a wave of Democratic Leadership followed in endorsing Kamala Harris is the nom
and she expressed her gratitude
Panda Express that it is her intention to earn and win the Democratic nomination
although we do not yet know the precise path through which Kamala Harris will fight for earn and win the Democratic nomination
one thing is clear
we
unequivocally
an enthusiastic grateful support of Kamala Harris for
as we look ahead
with new energy and excitement toward the grave magnitude
an historic hope of the next 107 days
we are also looking back
to a conversation we had with Kamala Harris last year
on what would have been
the 50th anniversary of Roe v
Kamala Harris has fought tirelessly to defend a woman's right to not have the government make decisions about her body
and we must now fight for her
as the woman who should lead this nation
as she encourages all of us in this episode
shoulders
all right
shoulders
we have an election to win
has to be about
all of us reminding
people that are not alone the way you have constructed this show this
this thing you've done it's very accessible so in the privacy and the quiet of their own moment whatever that might be while they're taking a walk or they're jogging are they working are they driving and I think that's really critically important because there's so much stuff out there disinformation misinformation
judgment that is
causing people and then after years of a pandemic
causing people to feel very alone
and you know when you feel alone when people feel alone
it makes them feel small it's very disem
and when we can remind them they're not alone and they're part of a community
that cares about them
it's empowering yeah it's a hug but it's more than a hug right now get up out of that chair shoulders back chin up well we are dumbfounded with excitement and gratitude today because we have the absolute honor to be in conversation with a woman who can has
and will continue to do very hard things vice president Kamala Harris
vice president Harris is the highest ranking elected woman in US history
the first South Asian-American Senator and the first woman or black American
to be the California Attorney General
among all her titles
she most cherishes the honor of being the daughter of shyamala gopalan Harris
who taught her to Never back down from a righteous fight
and thank God for that because she is leading what we believe to be the movement of Our Generation the movement for Reproductive Justice
and she's inviting all of us to join her
thank you thank you for being with us vice president Harris it is my joy and honor thank you and thank you for your voice for all of you this is a moment for
all of us to understand our power
as an extension of our rights
and to join together in Sisterhood and fellowship among all people regardless of gender
to speak up
so thank you it's great to be with you guys you do it all the time you speak up all the time thank you
this weekend would have been the 50th anniversary of
which held that
are constitutional right to privacy included abortion and this protection allowed us to control our own bodies
Planner on families and make the futures of our choosing
in do
the quarterback rated that Liberty with a stroke of a pen
the three of us heard that
we
grieve
terrified and we called each other first how did you feel
when you heard the news and who did you call first
so I was on my way that day to Illinois to be with
Congress member Lauren Underwood
to continue the work that we have been doing together and before that I've been doing on maternal mortality
so I was on my way to do the work of highlighting one of the Great
long-standing issues in our country which is that women are unnecessarily dying in connection with childbirth with particular impact on black women or three times more likely to die native women
twice as likely to die rural women 1 1/2 times more likely to die
and the decision came down and I called my husband immediately
because he's about the only person I could call with the funeral that I had in a most unrestrained wedding with language for the moment and I just you know I've seen a lot I
in many ways there is very little
surprises me but I was shocked
renew from the lake opinion that it was likely to happen
when something actually does happen
that is so outrageous
and and you know in the contrast for me that day when I heard about it was
here
going to work on an issue that has been long ignored
and hypocrisy
of these people who
pretending and put themselves out
is caring about the sanctity of life
what have been
holy absent
in those numbers when it comes to the fact that women are dying every day in America
so there were many layers to how I was feeling at that moment and
you know but it's it's also one of those moments that we just
resolve okay got
we're going to have to fight so right after Rowe was overturned
you hit the road to meet with everyday citizens and activists and state lawmakers in red blue
and swing States
to witness and understand the real personal impact of the reversal of row how are people already being hurt by this
in profound ways
let's start with
if we can pull back the subject at hand
among the many
Roots if you will
that are part of this issue in terms of what's behind
it is
the judgement
that has existed probably since the beginning of time about women's sexuality I love that we're going here right yes let's do it and and then the associated
judgment that is designed to make her feel bad
and or embarrassed
Andor as someway subversive or an outcast
and the net effect of that on this issue and many other associated
but on the issue of of abortion or an unwanted pregnancy is to make her feel as though she did something wrong
I say this as maybe a long way of saying
God only knows the stories we don't know
because
those people are not telling their stories because they feel so
and then what is the word it might be embarrassed they might feel
but they will be judged they might feel they've done something wrong
and they will therefore silently suffer
and the stories have been the story of for example the tragedy of the 10 year old girl
who is molested
and had to leave the state of Ohio to
in another
the doctor in that state who I have talked with is now has been facing threats to her life and is now facing a threat that she may lose her medical license
and let me tell you something
for a large part of my career as a prosecutor specialised in
violence against women and children
the idea that there would be laws being passed
like in Florida where I'm about to go that would make no exception for rape or incest
is immoral
cuz again let's break it down
what has happened to that individual is that their body has been violated
they have been denied the ability to have power over their own body to decide whether they want to engage in this act
it is one of the most horrendous crimes because of the outrageous nature
of
which is a violation of someone's body
and then
so called leaders sanctimonious
are suggesting that and after that has happened you who has endured and survived that
will not have a choice over what happens to your body
if you
I need to have an abortion
compounding the very violation
that is about bodily autonomy
and the right all people should have to live in a way
that allows them to make certain
fundamental decisions about their life
so there's so many layers to this issue
in terms of what makes these proponents
of Dobbs and these laws that are being passed just wrong
cuz here's the bottom line
the government should not be telling
people what to do about their own bodies
and one does not have to abandon their faith
more deeply held beliefs
to agree the government should not be telling her what to do
let her make that decision with her
priest or Pastor Rabbi let her make that decision if she chooses with her loved ones but the government
does not have a right to be making that decision for her
that is such an important
piece of this to show that
reproductive Justice
is actually religious liberty because there as you said the Jewish teachings
the overturning of row violates thousands of years of teaching one of the cases that went up with row
was actually the opposite where where the Army was trying to tell a woman that she had to get an abortion to keep her job so it's the flip side of the same coin it has nothing to do with the actual procedure it's the choice
of what your body will and will not do
exactly and
the point that you are making that I think we all have to make repeatedly to all of our friends
is
this movement about allowing people to make this decision and choose for themselves
is not a movement to convert people in terms of their religious beliefs
this is not what that is
it is simply to say
you
what you believe in what your faith dictates
and leave the others to do
their faith and their beliefs dictate and in that way
it is such a fundamental point which is about one of the foundational Concepts and principles upon which our country was founded freedom and liberty I say take back the flag on this issue this is about freedom and liberty yes yes
that's right I mean what we have learned from black and brown intersectional activist from the beginning
is that reproductive Justice doesn't have to do with a particular law or particular legislation when we back up
as Monica Simpson of Sister song says this is about full-scale Liberation it is about the ability to walk through the world and do what we must do
and be safe in doing it and I think if we all can understand that it is
it is about the full-scale Liberation that is the use and enjoyment of your life as you see it right everyone can get behind
there's a phrase for that
which is self-determination yes right how about that right how about that
self-determination
if we think about it again going back to
just the point about who are we as a country what do we stand for what do we believe in what what was our reason for being
it was about self-determination and freedom and liberty
it was about working against the idea that the government would be big brother and make decisions fundamental decisions
for you about your life and those things that are in particular the most private aspects of life one other way of thinking of it is
individual
should have the right to make decisions about the matters of
heart and home
will you marry
it's about
what you choose to do within the privacy of your home that is not about hurting anyone else
but the choices that you right
should have the ability to make the freedom to
in our homes
our bodies yes our homes are our bodies

we were talking about how this is the first time in history that the Supreme Court has reversed itself to take back a constitutional right
from the American people
and we know this is not the end of that but the beginning so what will extremist Republicans do next to restrict our reproductive Liberties and will it include contraception and IVF so Clarence Thomas
set the quiet part out loud in the decision in the Supreme Court Dobbs decision
Clarence Thomas
so the quiet part out loud
calls into question
the right to contraception and the right to marry the person you love
and
we should all take that very seriously
thankfully Congress did on the second piece and we passed then
a bill the Congress passed which the president quickly and joyfully signed into law protecting
the fundamental right to marry the person you
but the right to access contraception I mean literally we should be understanding and all people of any gender should be understanding
let's be clear about this it is about the decision that you should be able to make about whether or not you get pregnant or whether or not you want to get somebody else pregnant
and in that way again all genders should be concerned about this speaking about being concerned about things so
my sister just mentioned what Monica Ray Simpson said about reproductive Justice
buy arrested a queer key strategist in the 1960s Civil Rights Movement said we are all one and if we don't know it we will learn the hard way yes we know you've talked about the intersection between voter suppression and abortion restrictions if we care about abortion rights
and we don't want to keep learning the hard way who else must we care about
and what other issues do we need to make our own
I love Venn diagrams we have heard so one day I might write a book I love you so
the three circles right and
how they over
and so on this issue and that's about intersectionality it's about also
the beauty of understanding
the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates
and when we can see it whoa the opportunity for Coalition building and building community
and reminding us we're not in this alone We're All in This Together not to mention what I think should be the the edict to all of us which is to say no one should ever be made to fight alone right we must stand up for each other
and the rights that each is entitled to so on the Venn diagram
I asked my team let's look at
where are the attacks are coming from
when we look at where the attacks are coming from what we find is that from the same place that you see an attack on a woman's right to make decisions about her body
you will see a tax on voting rights
attacks on lgbtq right
if you want to put a fourth circle on there it's an interesting exercise to then figure out who's who's engaged in bookbags
and what that should tell us is again that there is a very significant over
in each one of these
and these fights one might ask what are they
they're about Freedom they're about Liberty they are also about dignity
you're about
and the dignity to which each person is entit
as part of their existence
should not have to be earned
is part of one's existence
must be and should be entitled to dignity
because the dignity is not no one is out there saying this is an easy decision willy-nilly what they are saying is that is precisely because this is such a difficult decision that it is yours to make in consultation with whomever you trust
and that is why
I believe it's about dignity because it's about trustworthiness on this spectrum make this decision it's an excellent point you
can be trusted with this decision when you cannot be
we have to go back all this right
because you as a human are not as trustworthy
as this other set of humans
who presumably are because as you have pointed out it's real hard to think of a law that
limits a man's control over any part of his body I want to ask that question for all of us yes I've only been replying it almost every day
it's about also looking at again
historical precedents for this sadly but
without going through all the history on this which is depriving for example women of the ability to vote to own property all kinds of things right
let's put all of that aside it is
also in the context this issue
the fact that the trajectory of our nation the direction of our nation
has has hopefully always been about making progress progress as defined
by many things including the expansion of Rights
not the Restriction of Rights
so what we have just experienced
is a restriction of rights that had been recognized
by the highest court in our land and in that regard I will say that as
Vice President of the United States
I meet with
heads of state foreign leaders
on a fairly regular basis I've now met with over 100
in person or
presidents Prime Ministers chancellors Kings
when we use the United States of America walk into those rooms to have those conversations
we generally have been able to walk in
chin up shoulders back talking about the importance of democracy
human rights
rule of
and in that way we have presented ourselves as a role
of all of those things
well the thing about being a role model we all know this
people watch what you do
to see if it matches what you say
people around the world are watching
is the highest court of our
just took a constitutional right
and my greatest fear is that autocrats and dictators
around the world
were there people are fighting for rights and freedoms let's talk about women who are fighting all around the world for their rights
and their autonomy
those autocrat
dictators
can look at them and say
well you want to hold out your friend the United States will look what they just did you sit down and in that way
we then appreciate that this issue the way it has gone down
will impact not only the people of America
but arguably people around the world
which brings us back to our fight
fighting to stand up and speak out about it
remind the people who are impacted that they are not alone
to focus on what is happening in these various States and in the United States Congress will also be something that people around the world will watch and those folks who are aligned with this
will feel a sense of confidence
but this is not over and we must continue to fight

Primavera Online prepares high school students for a bright future with a strong mind Merit and performance award which helps with college trade schools certifications and the military enroll in grades K-12 at choose primavera.com what are some concrete ways every person listening to this can plug into the reproductive Justice movement
one of the ways is to use your social media power
there's so much misinformation and disinformation out
and again so many people feeling alone right
but they're on social media
and to the extent
we can each use the platform we have
to say here's the correct information here's the incorrect information when we hear it like just to do it keep doing it even if you've done it before keep doing it
to reinforce the
reinforce the point that there is help out there
and let people know where there is help based on what you know to be helping your community or your
or in another
there is what we can do that is about supporting the organizations that are supporting the people who need help
for people who live in states that have
practically outright band abortion you know 16 States have
13 of them
the band starts at fertilization which is essentially an outright
so helping people figure out how they can get to
and tap into
services that can help them if they're working two jobs and they've already got kids the majority of women who who seek abortions have children
Child Care is expensive you got to travel that's a bus ticket to train ticket to plane ticket that's expensive
you know people are barely being able to pay
and and so supporting the organizations that are helping folks who need to travel
supporting the organizations that are providing legal assistance
it is outrageous that not only do many of these states
not make an exception for rape or in
the number of states that are criminalizing Healthcare Providers providing for
prison time for a nurse or a doctor is crazy
yes if we were talking about this a few years ago he said this is just bananas that's never going to happen it has happened so supporting the organizations that are supporting folks who might need Legal Services
and then there's elections cuz Hey elections matter
Hoosier
prosecutor is Mathers specially if you are in a state that is criminalized healthcare providers
who your your Governor is matters for sure who your attorney general is matters
and then who your local representatives are that matters because
they're going to be in particular if they if they work in your state house as a legislator
they're going to be the ones either pushing for greater protections or pushing back against restrictions
but a lot of States blue and red States
to convene state legislators
to remind them that we need them and they're not going to be on the front lines cuz this is moved out of then the federal piece
into the states so be active in Statewide organizations
get involved and you know let's all be joyful warriors on this too right my sister was dying to ask you about being a joyful Warrior so did most joyful Warrior your mother was a pioneering scientist and you picked up a lot of your leadership
principles from her yes and in her lab you learned that
innovation
is what can be unburdened by what has been indeed and this moment is terrifying and it's grueling and talk about elections matter where we're years and then we're tired
so it's terrifying but it also can be seen as a moment of a gift right because
what kind of Siri is not going to take us from here
we are doing something new or we are just standing by and letting them take whatever else they're going to take next
so what do you see as the gift of this and what do you see as
The Innovation going forward for what this movement can feel like and what can
so I think moments like this
remind us
that when we decide I ain't having this
okay got it
I'm getting out there I'm going to go
talk to some friends I'm going to do my social media
as necessary I'm going to join an organization
and the effect of that activism
is always a really wonderful thing I think for an individual which is to see the incredible power and
that we each have
to
each other
it's an incredible
you know one can say you can you know how strong am I looking my muscles right and flex your arm
but I think the true expression and measure of strength is not based on who you beat down it's based on who you lift up that's
for a lot of people
they may
I think we all did some things were long settled so I don't have to worry about that that's good
those folks 50 years ago who got
I decided they did their thing and I have benefited and we're all good
and then
the Dobbs decision came down and everyone realized I got it can't take anything for granted
got to be active and hold on
to our games
cuz otherwise they may atrophy deteriorate or B Tok
so the strength of the moment is to remind us
we have to be Vig
and that's okay
because it's just about acknowledging the fact and the truth of the matter which is
anything that is precious and important
requires our vigilance
in protecting it
because the duality of these things is that usually the thing that gives us great strength can also
be very fragile meaning if we don't protect
before we end I have to ask one thing so
when we get all of our joyful Warriors podcasters together
and we do all of the things you've suggested and we get a democratically controlled Congress and we get a Democrat into the presidency
do you have confidence that Democrats will go to the match to write bodily autonomy into law once and
I absolutely do believe
and I think that
again what we can look at just the most recent track record on marriage
yes because we've been pushing for it for a long time but we thought okay we're good
can I perform some of the first same-sex marriages in the country we thought we were good you know the courts and now we realize okay the courts may have made certain decisions but we can't assume that will be forever so Democrats
and and some Republicans came together and said okay let's pass
this bill that codifies puts into law the right to marry the person you
similarly I think that
everyone has been shocked into being fully awake that we need to
do something in Congress but sadly we still don't have all the numbers we need and that's why
elections in terms of who your Congress member is and who your Senator is really matters because the one thing that can end all of this in terms of these bad laws
is if we at the federal level
say that it is a right
and it cannot be taken away
