hey friends welcome I have a rare treat for you today just a few days ago I sat down for an interview with vice president yes of the United States Vice President Kamala Harris who was in Minnesota on stop 6 of her reproductive Freedom store she's been traveling around the country in a show of support for Reproductive health care including abortion against what the Vice President says are extremists waging a full on attack against abortion has become a key issue in the 2024 presidential campaign and Minnesota has a become an important state President Biden won Minnesota in 2020 fairly handily but a large percentage of Voters have been critical of the Biden administration's response to the Warren and I had time to discuss topics including her reaction to nearly 20% of Minnesota Minnesota and the potential destruction of democracy I think you're going to enjoy this conversation
play Sharon hello how are you so much
you were the first president or vice president to visit to visit an abortion clinic today and
I'm wondering I know a lot of minnesotans are pro-choice but there are still a large number that are anti-abortion yeah and
they are just not going to change their mind on that topic but yet they don't support president Trump
knowing that you're not going to change their mind on abortion what would you do
to win their votes
thank you for being here thank you
I will say this
there is so much about this issue
to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs
as much as anything this issue is about
the fact that the government should be telling people what to do with their body
so the freedom to make a decision for yourself that you don't believe in it and you wouldn't do it
to agree that the government should not be telling women what to do with their body
I think a lot of people are realizing that
those who had a long-standing opposition to abort
are also realizing that things have started to happen that they did not in
black women having miscarriages
make women being denied emergency care because the
the hospital staff are afraid that they could go to jail for administering care
what happened we saw with ivy
and the fact that that can happen now because of the case that took away these freedom
I would ask
people to to consider
that there are many issues that play on this issue right now including the taking of freedoms and individual rights
but the other issues
better at play are really about a fight for our democracy the former president has
open
admire dictators
I said he would be a dictator on day
the former president
has stated an intention to weaponize the Department of Justice against his enemies
we look at
America stands for and our pride is Americans include I think for most of us
knowing that we are a world leader
with the authority to talk about the importance of democracy and rule of law
as vice president I've now
met with over 150 world leaders president's Prime Ministers chancellors and
and they look to us I mean we still have
earned and self-appointed authority to walk in those rooms and talk about
the strength of democracy the need to to fight corruption
importance of rule of
we've never seen this election is not about a debate
trickle-down the
this is the selection is so much bigger than
how do you feel about regulation or deregulation
election is really about
on the one
Joe Biden who stands for rule of law who stands for America standing by our friends
who stands for
the importance of holding an office with dignity and respect for other people
and on the other side someone who is openly
rejecting many of those principles
I mean I'll share with you I think that's something really kind of perverse is taking on over the last few years that suggests that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on
will you beat down
you know that that somehow is a sign of weakness to have empathy
the strength of character of a leader is someone who has some level of concern and care for the suffering of other people and then does something about that
Chuck Schumer gave a speech earlier today on the floor of the
he talked about how it is time for
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
to go essentially he said he
is concerned that Israel will become a par
if it continues on the path that it's on and as I know you know Chuck Schumer is a very high-ranking Jewish man in the United States government so these are exceptionally strong words from him you've been a leader in the Biden Administration about this topic you know that Warren Israel
Biden Administration agree with Chuck Schumer's statements that it's time to have new elections in Israel
I would not and we would not
tell the people of any other country who they should vote for when they should hold elections
we believe that it is up to the people and in this case
the people of Israel the Israelis to make a decision about who leads their government and and how that happens
super Tuesday we just have that here in Minnesota and of course President Biden won 19% of democratic voters in the on super Tuesday in Minnesota voted uncommitted
and I know that has to be something that your Administration is keeping an eye
and I'm wondering
what might the biden-harris administration be prepared to do in terms of potential policy changes or Outreach to win back those 19% of uncommitted Voters because you need them to show up
they matter
what is one of the reasons that I'm in Minnesota today is to make that clear and reinforce the point that
the people of Minnesota matter and
that you know we respect
the fact that
people feel very strongly about what we are Witness
and
and I understand that
I understand
and so we're here to talk about a variety of issues that in addition to that include for example again today in honor of women's History Month talking about
issues that directly impact women including choice to talk about the economy to talk about what we are doing in terms of addressing issues like climate crisis
and many other issues including strengthening the economy around supporting small businesses something I care deeply about
so we'll continue to talk to them and talk to everyone
there's a new pull out that
from a new pull out from USA Today and Suffolk University that suggests that perhaps independent voters
have not yet been convinced that you
are capable of being the president
which you have said that you are you have said that you there's no question about that that you are prepared and ready to leave if the worst should happen and you know and President Biden knows cuz he's spoken about this many times that he's not a young
and I know this is something that voters
think about they have to think about
what would happen if the worst came to pass so I'm wondering
do you still look first of all do you still agree that you're ready to leave and secondly of course what what misconceptions do you think voters might have about you
every vice president
they are taking off to be prepared to lead
if something should happen to the president
there have been 48 vice presidents before me I'm the 4
each one of us at some time or another has been presented with this question and I believe each one of us has had the same answer I am no
the work of Vice President includes the work that I have done for the last 3 years
for hemispheres
it includes the work of having met directly
over 150 world leaders
heading up a number of initiatives that directly impacted the American people
and there is the work that is about doing what we must do
to understand the role that the United States of America plays in the context of the world
I was the first woman district attorney of San Francisco and reelect
first Attorney General of the State of California and re-elected around the second largest Department of Justice in the United States second only to the United States Department of Justice
how's the United States Senator represented one in eight
it is about people having information
to be able to form their opinions and I think that's important
I want to hear you tell voters what is at stake in this election
there's been a lot of talk about voting for a third-party candidate
RFK JR this week you know announced that he might be considering a couple of VP options like Aaron Rodgers or former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura who is also a former professional wrestler
what actually is at stake and
what would you say to somebody who's thinking about voting third party in this election
and as we discussed earlier
we are looking at two major Wars that are occurring in the world
it is our Administration Joe Biden myself and others
who have stood firm and strong around
position on standing with our friend Ukraine
wow an adversary Russia
has violated long-standing International rules and Norm
around sovereignty and territorial integ
it is very important that right now when the the first war in Europe in 70 years
that therapy leadership of the United States government who understands the importance of standing with our allies
and continuing to strengthen
military alliances that we have in the context of NATO
when we look at where we are in terms of the importance of having leadership
that address is long-standing issues
that many presidents before and administration's said they would tackle but did not such as infrastructure remember infrastructure week it never happened
we got it done
so here in Minnesota and around the country 50 states
many of them being run and carried out by members of organized labor IBEW and others
to do the work of upgrading America's infrastructure whether it be sidewalks or airports
the reality is that in the selection everything is at stake in terms of
one having capable competent leadership
but also what is at stake in terms of the risk on the other side of that split screen
I'm having chaos
and the potential destruction of our democracy
as it relates to these third-party candidates you know
tell me more a little bit more about what's at
I would love to hear your take on what is at stake with the Supreme Court
will the Supreme Court dissolve is at stake in every election and as we saw you know we talked about it back in 2016
that presidential elections can determine the future course of the United States Supreme Court
When Donald Trump ran
he stated his intention
to
members of the United States Supreme Court that would overturn Roe v Wade
he was elected
that's what he did and now we are experiencing a healthcare crisis in America because of it
so there is a direct connection between presidential elections and who sits on the
and that is one of the many consequences of an election
and the reason therefore that people care about issues like that
do you think that if Donald Trump gets elected
that they will try to pass a National Abortion
do you think that they will be successful
Joe Biden is very clear
that on our watch he would vet
any attempt by the United States Congress to pass a national
I want to talk very briefly about
character
do you
Character Matters more in a leader or do policies matter
and I think that they are also
in many ways inextricably linked
the character of
of a lead
cares about the condition and well-being of other people
produces the kinds of policies that we have
where we have the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors because we know that our seniors
for years
so many of otherwise had to make a decision about whether they can afford their insulin prescription or afford to put food in the refrigerator
the kinds of policies that
care
student loan debt understanding that so many of our young people come out of school
and are unable to even think about starting a family or buying a home because they're carrying so much
and we have not forgiven over $138 billion dollars of student loan
for over 4 million people including for our teachers and firefighters in public servants erasing their debt completely
so these are just but a few examples of what leadership that car
Ashley accomplishes by way of Pollock
and
I do believe that the American people want
leaders who
and it's not just about themselves
it's about the people
that's the kind of administration we are you look at the split screen on the other side
he'll fight all day long for himself
but is he fighting for the people
what message would you send to somebody who is as of this moment undecided about who they should vote for in November
I would ask that person to
take a look at
the record
take a look at do you care about
insulin and costing $35 a month for a seniors knowing how many of our seniors have suffer
take a look at the fact that before we came in Medicare could not negotiate drug prices
for seniors and we are now
making that happen so that we're going to cost cap the annual cost of prescription medication at dollars a year
I'd ask folks to take a look at whether you care about the fact that we are
bringing manufacturing back to America
we have created over 800
new manufacturing jobs and we are making
a lot of the work that otherwise we were Outsourcing and buying from other countries are making it now here in America
and that means the 15 million jobs that we have created
and it also means dealing with supply chain issues which we all experience during the pandemic
and it means strengthening our ability to be a leader around the globe so I'd ask people to think about it ranging from something like
you know access to capital for small businesses think about your favorite small business
and what it means for them to be able to have more access to the money they need to stay open and grow
look at it if you have any money in your family who who went to college and and has student loan debt look at it in terms of anybody you know who has diabetes and is a senior
and what our Administration and what the people who voted in 2020 for us actually helped accomplish thank you thank you so much thank you so much thank you very much I appreciate it thank you thank you did you know that you can now listen to Heroes where it gets interesting to sign up the show is hosted by executive producer if you enjoyed this episode we would love to have you give us a rating reviews for being here today and I'll see you again soon
