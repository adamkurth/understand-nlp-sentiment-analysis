everybody just wrapped up once again the biggest interview my entire life with number 45 in his own building president Trump talk a lot about the Afghan withdrawal talked a lot about China talked a lot about what's wrong with the country please like comment and subscribe share this with everyone you know much love from SRS enjoy the show Mr President Trump
it's an honor to be here in Vegas to interview you and so you need no introduction but I'm here is a US veteran I served in SEAL Teams and is the CIA contractor and I just want to talk to you about some of the most concerning topics when it comes to the the combat veteran population
good and so I'd like to start with
some rhetoric that's been in the news lately I don't believe it and there's been multiple times where the media is misconstrued some of the things that you say about veterans the latest being
supposedly you calling
veteran wounded veterans should have been shot or wound
suckers and losers
made-up story was made up by a magazine
and I think it was the Atlantic which is a radical left magazine
and as soon as I heard it I said that's
play a terrible thing and you don't get rid of it you know they make these things and they just use it and use it the opposing side they know it's false I had 26 people that said that never happened
who would
a stupid person or a person that's mentally ill
and you know as you know better than anybody I rebuilt our military
we gave 86,000,085 billion over the way to Afghanistan so stupidly but far bigger than even that I rebuilt our military
I had the best relationship with the military of any president
and respect the military more than anybody
and they just made up this horrible
I was
in his massive rainstorm
and I supposed to take helicopters to a certain place in Paris a little complicated I don't want to be too complicated
and the helicopters weren't able to fly the military helicopters our helicopters
and I looked at it I said
not going to be able to fly so I wanted to drive
by the time we
realize we had to drive it was very
and everybody talked me out of going and all of a sudden and it was a mistake I wanted to go and
somebody made up the story that I said that
and I have so many witnesses I have one of them in this room right now he's a witness that I never said it nobody would say that
and I went to one the following day in a big Cemetery
but they said I said about soldiers I think it was World War I soldiers
the suckers and losers and they're
GR
think of it they gave their life for our country
this was
Paris it was an American cemetery
and they said
and this was somebody
that actually he didn't say they made it up with a magazine they make things up they don't even have sources
they make things up out of thin blue like a storytel
and I wanted you to ask me this question
because
I think it's a terrible terrible thing
but they make up
and then one guy who's a very son of a low-life guy he is a low
they got one confirmation
and 26 people said it never happened
Buffalo the one confirmation was the guy that I fired
a terrible stupid person actually that couldn't do the job well
and I fire
any sort of confirmed it I don't know how he confirmed it but he did
it's a totally false story nobody could say nobody would say that and I would say this to military people
I'm the president of the United States I say suckers and losers they gave their
it's just a a disgraceful
storage on and
all I do is deny it we have so many witnesses
I said you know that's one of those questions where no matter how you answer
you lose you understand that I do I can sit here and talk about it for another 20 minutes
and at the end people would even if they have a doubt you've lost just a little doubt they need only need a 2% doubt
I would think that if people heard that I think if I heard that maybe I believe it if I was in the military you know what do they know they're sitting there and they heard the story
put out by this real rag that's failing badly losing a lot of money
and you know it's interesting I was doing a rally and
I was walking past press and some guy shouted to me I think from the mag
is it true you called them suckers and lizards
military in the graves
now that's a loser because as soon as I heard it I said
that you can't respond to
because no matter how vigorously you deny
I mean they have an expression for it I won't use the expression but it's a bad expression it's when they ask you a question that no matter how you answer
it leaves a Telltale St
and it's a shame that they can get away with it and we have libel laws now where you can do anything you can sue you can spend 25 million suing people
and they laugh at
it's a disgrace shouldn't be allowed but it is allowed since we're on a long form podcast and we're not going to take anything out of context or is there anything that you would like the veteran population to know about what you think of them that I love them that I respect them that I rebuilt our military that I got budgets that nobody's ever gotten that I increase their pay because of the respect I have
if you take a look at what's happening with the military
it's horrible under Biden
this this woman this woman is a
she's a communist I guess I mean and I look at action I don't look at words
Define the police who is the head of defund the police now all of a sudden she wants to you know deny it
she was for On The Border she was the Border
and millions of people poured into our country
add different prisons and they're from jails they're from mental institutions and insane asylums are all different you know
that's the mental institution on steroids as you know
and they're from in the terrorist
in many countries
recently
they came in from the Congo in Africa
where do you come from I think 22 people
but many more than
they're acting like their jails into a country they said where do you come from
Chicago where in the Congo jail
what did you do
they wouldn't
we have the toughest people in the world being dropped into a country and not from just South America from South America yes
venezuel
the crime rates down 72%
their prison population is way down their mental institution population is way down to this is true with many countries and that's because they're dumping their prisoners
did dumping their gang members MS-13 that dumping everybody into our country we have a totally open border
and she's a Marxist she's really a Marxist her father was is a Marxist professor
this woman
ran against I guess about 22 Democrats
she was the first to leave the rice
she left the race before she even got to Iowa the
primary State as you
a lot of people followed and Biden which is shocking because he's terrible
terrible for the military by the way but he's the worst president in the history of our country in my opinion
and yet what happened to him shouldn't happen he got 14 million vote she got no vot
it was a coup it was an overthrow of a president there's never been anything like that
that doesn't mean he's good or he's copied it but he did win
and then they said we don't want you you know we had a debate
and after the debate he was 17 points down in polls
and they went to him they said you're not going to win you can't win
and we want to get somebody else
and he didn't want to go and he fought it and then they said I think they're going to pull out the 25th Amendment
which is mental acuity
or something
and he said I'll go now they're trying to act like it was a friend it wasn't friendly he's a bitter man right now
what happened to him
you go through primaries you win I mean you won against 22 people and I think he got very lucky
things happened I understand exactly what happened but he got lucky but it doesn't matter he won
getting 14 think of it he got 14 million but she got none she never made it
to the
contest which is Iowa
and now she's running
okay now I'm not complaining because she should be easy to
this country is not ready for a Marxist or a communist this country is not ready for somebody that wants to defund the police
that said that they will never be fracking in our country if we don't Frack if we don't drill for oil and gas
we won't have a country because that's where the power comes from that's you know we can talk about all sorts of things but
that's the power that powers up our plans
