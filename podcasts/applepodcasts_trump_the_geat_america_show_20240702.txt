and as of today with the 6-3 decision by the US Supreme Court
it looks like President Trump is well on his way to becoming the 47th president
call Mr President congratulations on the Supreme Court ruling the country is obviously reverberating with all sorts of emotions
or give us a sense of your emot
when you first heard the news
well I was honored because this pressure they play The Ref these people on the left they are
just you just don't know where they come from it's hard to believe when you look at how bad they are for our country
criticizing people hoping to get good decisions out of them and you see it
play Bobby Knight the great basketball coach your throat chairs and do everything he said no no
you know that's what they do they play the
but in this case it didn't work they are
I really think that the Supreme Court should be it's a very proud moment for the Supreme Court they did the right thing it was a strong ruling
some people thought they may come in with a very weak ruling and that would have been very bad for
immunity for the president you have to have a community for a president otherwise the president is going to be a figure
the president's not going to do the job that the president was supposed to be doing
and you understand that probably as well as anybody
you've long been talking about this subject
and this is a very Monumental ruling very powerful ruling
and I was very proud of the Supreme Court for Having the courage to do what's
I certainly would join you in that without any surprise to anyone I'm sure watching this broadcast but to to think that the attempts at intimidation have been rampant for really 9 years as they politically persecuted you your family the Supreme Court Justices themselves and Republican leaders it is it's just a moment in history of the Court the courage of so many are in Washington DC emanated from one man
and there seems to be fairly Universal conviction on this part as well that you were the one who introduced the idea of courage to the Republican party and that it is now truly your party to lead and you are the perfect leader for the Times many comparing you to Churchill in 19
what's 39 and your leadership critical to the survival of the Republic itself
what are your thoughts
that you say that because I know where you come from I know your knowledge your level of knowledge is at the top and that for you to say that is is very nice and look we need courage in this country the country is is we're failing Nation we are sadly and badly failing Nation right now
do we have a man that has no
capability whatsoever to be president
and you said that the other night at the debate
he's
and we're just going to be failing to a level that we're not going to have much of a country left anymore we may not have another election again you know there are those that say
do we keep going this will be our last election this is such an important election this is the most important election
in the history of our
we had problems with the Border
and it was very bad but it was nothing compared to what it is right now right now they're allowing
millions and millions of people to come in from other countries and not just South America and they're coming in think of
they're coming in from jails and prisons from mental institutions insane asylums many terrorists levels of terrorism that we've never
terrorist that we've never even imagined
would be coming into this country and they just pouring
some people say they do it because they hate the country
some people
okay they do it cuz they're stupid
but regardless of why they're doing they're destroying our country and we have to stop at we have to stop at immediately
that this is going to be a difficult difficult period not only the remaining months of the campaign but the the first years are at least of your presidency will be very tough the policy choices that you will have to make that you will have to
undertake the miss
secure the border secure the nation
National Security as well as
focus on what must be done to restore prosperity and peace to the nation because we are not the farthest thing but a far thing from a nation at peace
are your thoughts about
priorities as you have been leading your campaign and taking the battles straight to the president who is has done such a wonderful job of securing our national security and
an absolutely restoring prosperity
so we have to immediately close the border and we still want people to come in but they have to come in through the legal process and we can do that that we want people I want people
but we have to secure the Border immediately and that has to do with not only people that has to do with drugs it has to do with human trafficking which is at all time it's at an all-time high
so we have to immediately secure the Border we have to immediately start you know to turn my user's drill baby drill we have more
we have more Liquid Gold under our feet than any other Nation more than Saudi Arabia more than Russ
we have to go we got we have to get our energy cost and that's going to bring inflation down but a lot of great things can happen one of the things we're going to have to do is we're going to have to go to the Eisenhower
General Eisenhower president Eisenhower was very big on deportation of people that came in Legally illegally
and we're going to have to go to that we're going to have to deport
tremendous numbers of people and we're going to start with the criminals and we're going to start with the people that come out of the mental institutions we cannot have them in our country it's not sustainable
it's not sustainable
the whole quality of life look at what's happening I mean I had lunch yesterday with the mother
of a young girl who was who was killed by
horrendous people 12-year-old girl by the way
but you see
all the time now you're seeing it all the time we can't have it and we're not going to have it
and we're going to bring peace and prosperity back to our country but we're going to have to deport a lot of people they
70% 72 percent
over a relatively short period of time
and it's not because of any other reason other than they've taken their gang leaders and
drug lords and everybody they moved them into the United States they moved all their Criminal
it'll be all like I'm surprised it's taken him that long
and that's true with many other countries do you look at crime rates are down all over the world you know why they're down because they're sending their criminals into the United States
you know baby stuff these are
vicious people and they're coming into our country and they're destroying our country because we have a president that has a low IQ he doesn't know what the hell he's doing
and we have to change that and that's always tough because as soon as you bring one person where you make a mistake and you
a person who's a beautiful father with a beautiful wife and beautiful children and they make a mistake and they end up on the front page of every newspaper and I think that all the killers is you know all the people that have killed people
are all wonderful so you know it's very tricky
great tricky problem politically trick
and a lot of traps all over the place but
we have to get the bed people we got to get them out and we got to get them out fast they're killing people all over the place and you see it every single day now you're saying that people getting killed by the biting migrants I call him the Biden migrants and that's exactly what they are
who could like open borders
being mandated to buy an electric vehicle that you don't want
because it doesn't go far and cost too much
yeah I could go to 40 things who could like these things
the the breadth of the problem is a tremendous of the intricacies of it the depth of these issues are tremendous and the nation understands I believe

Rodger what a great day to talk with you a man who has been associated with worked with and supported Donald Trump for decades
and to see him
absolutely exonerated
a validated by the Supreme Court
what a moment in history
are and many are saying right now
but this is the most important ruling
to be handed down by the court and its history
well what's happened here is Donald Trump is won his due process rights to see the
the cabal of corrupted prosecutors trying to expedite these federal charges against him in a Witch Hunt rushing to try to do it before the election to impact and therefore interfere with the election are Furious that Trump fought for and got his due process rights and therefore they're not going to be able to try to Railroad him or Lynch him
before many legal questions are solved and settled in the courts their future hearings but it's all next year so this is a great victory for letting the people decide let the people decide not the courts who should be the next president that New York frame job didn't sit well with the American people because it stinks of what it is manipulation of the law even Andrew Cuomo said his last name was the former Attorney General
so it is and then Trump's Stellar performance in the debate where he's focused he's funny he's strong he doesn't take the bait he remains totally focused on pounding
Biden on the economy and the border and then we see the physical deterioration the public meltdown of Joe Biden on national television it was
it's what we've been saying for some time which the Democrats invented but the man is not up to the job
causing the greatest split in the Democratic party since the Vietnam War in 1968
it's absolutely incomprehensible
why the Corp
nationalist Med
I'm not sure they're National is there an actual would take that
billions and billions of dollars whether it's an advertising whether it's in a data you name
to imagine that they actually
decided that they would give up the idea
a purity of objectivity of
and recent
it's it's absolutely unbelievable
basically told the American people go straight to hell
we don't really think you're an important franchise anymore and they lined up with the aligned themselves
Democratic party now
and and decided to destroy their franchise
I don't know if it's recoverable
I don't think so look I think this was a Gambit going wrong I think Biden intended to challenge Trump to CNN debate certain that Trump will decline because of the entirely rigged situation
to their shock and surprise Donald Trump who had already said anytime anywhere Joe said okay I'm in
brushed aside the disadvantageous rules when in under the rules performed I think incredibly and Biden literally made a fool of himself we read today the Biden advisers were upset about the lack of fact checking on Donald Trump really
from the with the President Joe Biden who said not a single
member of the service of military service died under his watch
as you forgotten Afghanistan entirely
I mean it was the guy was out to lunch he he he he he recycled every
debunked disproved completely discredited attacks on Trump including the phony calling Vectren sucking suckers and losers and that the fraudulent he said Nazis were very fine people not even remotely what he said he recycles all those lies then he says he inherited a a a a a 16% inflation rate when it was 6.3
I mean it was it was incredible and now the big guns on the left the New York Times Politico the Philadelphia Inquirer all the big boys are beginning begin immediately like on you like on cue from who knows maybe Barack Obama to say Joe this was a disaster this is a meltdown Joe must go there's now a deep cleavage in their party as the Biden's digging their heels and Dawn by Kamala Harris this is you can't even make this stuff up the emperor had no clothes
983 it's amazing that there as we look at what happened in DC in the course of a short week to see this result
I am the the debunking of an entire Administration an entire presidential campaign and a figurehead
who couldn't possibly be in any way preserved there is just no in my view no way back for Joe Biden in the American political scene he's
this is what you have though this is akin to the situation with Woodrow
election 1913 1919 Wilson had an incapacitating stroke he was physically and mentally incapacitated
his wife Edith Galt Wilson with the acquiescence of Colonel House of the white house chief of staff Edward house essentially never allowed Wilson to appear in public and his wife was a defective
when it came she made all major decisions when it came time for him to sign documents she would have put a pet in his hand and move his hand
that's exactly what you have today Jill Biden is running the country the babysitter who just started an affair with when he was married to his first wife before she was tragically killed in a car accident or who is now the de facto president of the United States and he says Donald Trump has the morals of an alley cat what about that
and thank you for being with us Rodger Stone we appreciate it thank you everybody for joining us here on the Great America show see you here tomorrow God bless you God bless America
