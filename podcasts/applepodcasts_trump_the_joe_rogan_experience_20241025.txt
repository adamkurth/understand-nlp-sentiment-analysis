I want to play this
but we decided we shouldn't play it because it could get copyright strike and we don't want to get the episode when we don't want anybody to have any sort of way to get it down sure but it was the episode of you when you're on The View and I think it was 2015 or 2006 like when you were running for president
you sat you got introduced as our friend Donald Trump Whoopi Goldberg is a big hug and a kiss Joy Behar gives you a big hug
Barbara Walters gives you a big hug they all loved you
they were all talking about how
you might be
you might be conservative in your financial positions but you're very liberal socially they were they were talking about you in such a favorable
the audience was cheering
and then you actually started winning in the polls and then the machine started working towards you
there's probably no one
in history that I've ever seen
that's been attacked the way you've been
and the way they've done it so coordinated
and systematically when you see those same people in the past very favorable to you like Oprah when you want Oprah Show choose encouraging you last week I did one of her last shows I think maybe Thursday or Friday that was a big deal being on Oprah's show the last
and I was like one of the last shows in that last that final
and I said boy we've come a long way since since that what was it
well the concept it was really like two different lives you know I had
a very wonderful life but I wanted to do this The Apprentice was still going very strong we had 12 seasons
and we had actually
Seasons 12 years over we had a couple of The Apprentice when you were running for president
no they had Arnold Schwarzenegger do it I was involved in that
I want I had enough of it and we did great it was doing great but
they wanted me to stay they all came to see me they said
we're going to give you a contract they wanted to extend my contract Mark Burnett is a great guy
then they wanted to extend the contract Mark said you're crazy don't run don't run
nobody gives up Primetime they said you know it's one of those little things which
probably
navigate to 79% for for running well for running against 20 some other people get turned out to be 18 180 people you know mostly politicians
they said who would do this I mean it's a long shot actually the heads of NBC came over
Poltergeist all the top people came over to see me try and talk me out of it cuz they wanted to have me extend The Apprentice was doing well so it was 14 years we had one two seasons where we had a double which rarely happens it was just a hot
and I said you know I want to do this what happened is previously
3 years 4 years before that
they did a Paul they had Mitt Romney and somehow they put me in a
and I blew everybody away I blew him away which isn't that hard frankly but I blew everybody away and I said that's interesting cuz I never really
give it that much real thought I thought about it but never real thought but I saw these polls were very
and so I was thinking about doing it then but I had a contract with the Apprentice plus I was building two big buildings at the time and I wanted to make sure they got finished up properly and it's one of those things
the kids were just sort of getting involved they're very capable kids but they were getting involved early on
so I did that I got them done I had some very good success
and I came on and then I thought about it for the next one after the Romney disaster
and I ran on a one against Hill
there's quite an experience but it was a different life because you're right the view I was in The View many many times
and they love me I mean even if people have criticisms about you people that didn't like you there was always feuds and stuff like that but the reality was
the thing turned on you when they found out that you were going to be president it was very coordinated and some people are catching on to that now there's a lot of people that were long-time Democrats like Elon and Bill Ackman and all these different very intelligent people yes very supportive what does what I wanted to ask you
what was it
when you actually got in cuz nobody really can prepare you for that when you're running for president you don't really know what it's going to be like when you actually get into office
what was the what did you think is going to be in office or when I decided to run see when I was saying so when I was in and one and was in the White House essentially
well first of all it was very surreal
that should have been surreal when I was laying on the ground I knew exactly what was going on I knew exactly where I was
they were saying you
all over the place because there was so much blood from the ear
you would know that better than it would they get the earnings anyway so and and I was thinking the other day
when when that happened I really knew where I was I knew exactly what happened I said I wasn't hit any
with
with the presidency
it was a very surreal experience okay and what's day one
the old post office it was we called it Trump National
and we sold it to the Waldorf AST
and it was a wonderful thing but I'm driving down I'm passing the
you've never seen so many motorcycles police military
you know it was a major thing I got
really the first time I used Air Force One land
and we're coming down and they were it was very I mean it was incredible
and we're going down Pennsylvania Avenue in the opposite direction you know normally used to go in one way and all of a sudden you're going the other way
the street was loaded
and I wanted to go out
and I wanted to wave to everybody but that wasn't
you know the kids a little bit dangerous right I mean when you watch like Kennedy and some others
but I really felt I don't know the love was so crazy and so
I did get out of the car for a brief you know just for a very short walk I thought it was very important to do and Melania got out with a beautiful dress on that became
sort of a staple it was people loved it
Baron
walking down the street
but where it really
amazing we get to the White House and now it's a little bit a little bit before dark beautiful
and we went up to the
president's quarters they come to presidential quart
and I'm standing
it is beautiful hallway
you're not funny nobody ever talks about the White House is being beautiful inside you know you think it's going to be everything's going to be all metal doors and stuff it's not
it's so beautiful I made my money largely on luxury
the hallway is like 25 ft wide the ceiling Heights area it's so beautiful
but I was standing there
and I said to the guys I want to see the Lincoln bedroom I had never seen the Lincoln bedroom I heard about the Lincoln
and I was standing with my wife
I said Do you believe this is the Lincoln
it was

it's like if you love the country but
the Lincoln
he was 6 foot 6 which then would be like
Lake Barron Trump
6 ft 60 was very tall then on top of that he works he wore that yeah there it is it's a long bed elongated
and because very you know people were shorter than you see some of the chairs are very very low to the ground actually
but he had the long
and they had you had the Gettysburg Address right on that right under that you can't see it here but right there the original version of the Gettysburg Address
and this is the original
I just looked around I said Do You Believe
because
I was never apart so even if you were a politician but I was never a politician it just I sort of just started right right all of a sudden I'm standing at the
and it was a very very surreal that room was so beautiful to me much more beautiful than it actually is you know to me when I looked at the
and the bed you can see it was a little bit longer had to be a little bit longer
he lost his son and they suffered the two of them suffered from Melancholia they didn't call it depression
they called it Melancholia and they suffered from
he was a very depressed guy and she was
I'm very depressed woman more so than
and on top of that they lost their
whose name was
and it was
just seeing it in the little pictures a little tiny picture I mean you can't see the details their little tiny everything of the
a little tiny picture of Tad
who he
and he was you know he
he was having a hard time because he couldn't beat Robert E Lee Robert E Lee won like 13 battle in a
and he was getting like a phobia like a fighter you know a lot about the fight
I went to a UFC
and it was a champion who was 14 and 1 about a year ago you would know the
14 and 1 and the only guy who lost to was this one guy
but the guy that he was fighting was like
almost just an average fighter lost numerous times what he beat this one guy
so I said okay I really don't know who you're talking about I will figure it out but about a year ago but the point is that he lost he wasn't nearly the fighters but
the one who was not nearly the fighter had beaten he's the only guy that beat the champ like 5 years before
and I said I'll take the guy that won the other
Lincoln had a I don't know I've never read this I heard it from
people in the White House
who really understand what was going on with
with the whole life of the white
put Lincoln
The Yips about in a way as the golfers would say he had a phobia about Robert E Lee said I can't beat Robert because Robert E Lee won many battles in a row he was just beating the hell out of you know they tried to get Robert E Lee to be on the north but he said
no I have to be with my state you know
what's this whole thing and he went to the
and he was I've had generals tell me we have some great generals the real General is not the one you see on television the ones that beat Isis with me
we defeated Isis in record time it was supposed to take
years and we did it in a matter of weeks
is a great General he's a tough guy season not wolf
but their favorite General
in terms of Genius was Robert
strategically
he took a war that should have been over
a few days and it was you know
years of hell
a vicious
so here I am standing there
add again I never really done this before you know I ran I ran a number of months before
I want I probably
I guess if you figured Max it out it would be
a year something like that so I had never run for office
and I did well I mean I wanted to debate with 18 people including me and
slowly but surely they started to disappear we had debates good Deb
what I want to get to is like what was the experience once you got inside what did you think it was going to be like in terms of like your ability to govern like this is your first experience governing anything you never been a governor private business but now all the sudden weather inside the White House
it was a surreal experience
and then
with time
that wears off with time it becomes you know your place where you stay and I was doing a lot of I was I had two things
did I really focused on governing the country and
survival
because from the moment I won
before I got to office all of a sudden it
they came down to me nobody has ever been treated that
and and you see that I mean you see we're in the Washington Post very early on they said well now the impeachment stuff starts and it did I mean it literally started from the
so I had survival and run the nation I had a combination most people don't have the survival they get
what did you expect though in terms of like once you got inside you had a point all these people how many appointments do you have to make when you have sex 10,000 appointments now they're different you have big ones and then they appoint write 100 and 200 people
put the president really is involved with approximately 10,000 appointments so you'll appoint a secretary of state and he will he or she will appoint a lot of people so it's a lot but in terms of major ones you probably have like a hundred but they're big
Treasury
military and how did you know who to
well I didn't I had you did so are you going to 17 times in Washington
and I never stayed over according to the Press which I think is probably right over the years
I was only there 17 times I never stayed over
so
set an alarm
this place is gorgeous but you know I don't know anybody it's like you you know you go to certain areas and other areas they may be great Washington was great Washington
not so great right now they're going to we got to fix it we got to make it better
is it very dangerous place very badly maintained place we're going to make it
I'm going to make it better we're going to bring it back
I was in a washing the guy was a New York
how was the New York Builder and I built buildings in New York and I knew that whole world but I didn't know the Washington world too well
and all of a sudden you're supposed to be appointing to people so what did you think it was going to be like versus like did you have any ideas of what it was going to be like and what was
well I was always involved in politics but usually from the standpoint of of a donor you know it was a big donor I gave money to politicians I enjoy
pictures of Ronald Reagan and me when I was married to like what year
I was a Democrat
I could get you the exact
put the the early 90
the early nineties I switched over eventually
they had a reform party I was thinking about doing that for a little while but then fortunately I didn't because
it's very hard you know it's a two-party system
and anytime you hear third party I know you like RFK Jr and so do I he's a fantastic I do but I thought that whole thing is an independent was nonsense it doesn't work it doesn't work because even if you do great
you're not going to get Congress you need now to say okay now I'll get half of Congress and never going to vote for
so even if you got there which is very hard
and I know how you feel about Bobby and I feel the same way and he's now with us but it it doesn't it's pure and simple it's a two-party system and somebody I won't mention his name but somebody spent $250 million dollars trying to get the nomination as a Reform Party candidate or whatever and they got just now
so
so it was it was really somebody that Not only was new to Washington but was new to Pol
the office of the presidency
over the years
presidents you've had 92% were politicians and 8% were Generals General Eisenhower General Washington write General George Washington yeah
so it's 8% you are no Admirals 8%
in 92 Cent politicians you know the politicians and they
so they never had a business guy or they never had a guy that wasn't elected to an office
they were all like Ronald Reagan was really he was a movie actor and then but he became the governor of California for
I think two terms and then he
so you never had a thing like this
but I you know in terms of me and sometimes I use it as an excuse
and I don't like having excuses actually but I use it as an EXC
I had to rely on people
I respect it or like but that I didn't know that well because I didn't know them that well
some of those people I campaigned against cuz you know when you have 18 people we had mostly politicians running
in the election you know running in the Primm
and they got knocked out one by one but I got to like some of them some of them I didn't like at all and I don't like them now
and I rely on them and I'd rely on other people so all of a sudden people would come in I'd like to recommend so-and-so to be Secretary of
and I have three four people recommend one thing I can tell you everybody wants the position of course
a lot of people don't want to work with Trump because Trump is tough to work with Etc
everybody wants to be any one of these positions they die for it now they don't want to be known I mean there's a particular guy
New York primarily very big very big very successful very
very strong very political although he's not a politician
he'd give anything to be Secretary of State but if they ask him no I don't think I would do it but in the meantime
but it's very dangerous to pick somebody outside of a politician because a politicians been basically vetted for years you pick a business guy
and they've never been vetted at all and there are you know the head of a big company or something but they've never been vett
you know nothing about his personal life you know nothing about where he's
when you put them in it's a little bit dangerous because
all of a sudden they get checked up and you hear things that you're saying wow this is not going to work out too
so it's very dangerous
picking people that are outside of politics is somewhat dangerous so you're kind of stuck in a position we have to pick established people and then the problem with established people is established people already indoctrinated into the system
the survivors
I find that you know what do you mean by steps when you say stuff they don't they don't have nothing they have nothing or
they're smart and Survivor one one little thing so there was a congressman years before I
and I was very close
and I needed a license on something and he was very important in getting a license but it was a little bit controversial
the license to this particular thing that was being
but I was close to this
and help them and everything else and I went to him I said I'd like to have you
and he said
let me take a look at it I said oh that's not too
but I really hope you're going to have it anyway he tapped me along for a long period of time and ultimately didn't do it and I said you are a stiff you could have done this thing so easy Etc but it was controversial
he was in Congress for many years like 28 years
and you know there's a reason when somebody's there for 28 years you got to be so smart you have a scandal
and I realize he was a
until they never do anything controversial they never take any chances or speak their opinion that's outside of
28 years
and he made it through a lot of people don't make it through it's a good way for non exceptional people to survive yeah so you're you're in there you have 10,000 appointments you have to make
so you're getting advice from people and it at one point did you have a moment in time where you realize like these are bad choices like some of these people I shouldn't have had in there oh yeah I think
so the one question that you asked me that I think you'll ask me that people seem to ask
I always come up with the same answer
the one mistake cuz I had a lot of success great economy great everything was great
are the military rebuilt at biggest tax cuts in history
we had a great presidency
three Supreme Court Justices most people get none you know you pick them young
you know even if a president is there for 8 years oftentimes they never have a chance I had three it was sort of the luck of the draw
but I will say that
it always comes back to the same answer
the biggest mistake I made was I pick some people I picked some great people you know
you don't think about that
I pick some people that
you shouldn't have picked I picked a few people
that I shouldn't have picked and any
a guy like Kelly who is a bully a bully but a weak person you know you know more about bullies than anybody probably around cuz you're dealing with a certain sport where the bullies are exposed very quickly but you know
he's bad Bolton was an idiot but he was great for me because I'd go in with a guy like a John Bolton you know John Bolton a friend of mine
call me up I was picking ball and he's a very smart guy his name is Phil Ruffin he's a very rich guy from Las Vegas one of the he's a great card player he doesn't play cards but she's a great person you know she's just a natural
good old poker
add Phil Ruffin is is a very very wise kind of a guy
add very one of the richest people around
that has a great success and understands people
it was in that I was picking Baltimore I picked both and they called up he said don't pick him
what is a bad guy or what no he wasn't in politics at all
various business
he's a bad guy he's just it always works out bad with that guy
I wish you told me this 2 weeks ago I already hired him you know he's
and and he was right
he was good in a certain way he's a nut
and every time I had to deal with
when they show
standing behind me this at all
Trump's going to go to war with us he was with Bush when they went stupidly into the middle
they should have never done it I used to say it is a civil
so I always got more publicity than other people and I didn't it wasn't like I was trying in
I don't know exactly why maybe you can tell me why
can you set a lot of wild
this bullshit pre-prepared politician lingo and even if they didn't agree with you they at least knew whoever that guy is that's him that's really him when you see certain people talk certain people in the public eye
you don't know who they are you have no idea who they are it's very difficult to see them in conversations they have these pre-planned answers they say everything it's very rehearsed you never get to the meat of
what were the one of the beautiful things about you is that you free ball like you get out and you do these huge events and you're just talking and you're making we've highlighted you on the show many times for you when you did this Biden impression when he's walking around he doesn't know what he's doing today
but it's like you and you're making fun of Elon what time do it in Elan impression it's great
you have like comedic
you'd be in jail like that's great timing but it's like that kind of stuff was unheard of as a politician like no one had done that
and I think it's going to need
at least the attitude of a comedian when you're doing this business
and they brush those out of the news like it was nothing to talk about it if there was a assassination attempts on Biden how hard people would be attacking the right how they would be trying to get guns taken away from people they would try to ramp up gun laws they would try to figure out some way to blame you if there was a tax on if Biden got shot in the year we would have never heard the end of it but I think he's in good shape because it's only consequential presidents if you take a look at what's happening
I'm for having countries pay us billions and billions and trillions even dollars I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China nobody took in 10 of the president
I do things that make
I mean that don't necessarily make me so popular I just do what's right
and when you do that you know you're more
we would have never had the attack on Israel at all Iran was broke I told China if you buy you can't do business in the United States under any I was
we going to go cold turkey with China some people think that would have been a good idea anyway but
if you buy any oil one barrel of oil from them you're not doing business I said that to many countries
Iran was broke they had no money for Hezbollah that no money for Hamas they
but I make myself
you know I mean I understand what I'm doing you make yourself
a
and it's a very dangerous business but if you just look at statistically
so I said I said something I don't know if it's right but one tenth of 1% for a race car driver that's pretty dangerous business write 1/10 of 1%
you see it in slow motion where the foot is like
an inch away from the head if it hits him the guy's gone but they die you know they die so 1/10 of 1% down and they certainly get hurt badly I mean they can't walk after a certain period of time
with the
if you look at
no it's a very dangerous position I never thought of that by the way when I did it and you know you don't you don't tend to that I just assumed because people love you on The Apprentice they were going to love you as a president with Hitler I mean even today like
they're going to take what you said about Robert E Lee oh Donald Trump won yes I love to take things out of context and distort
but they don't even have to take a minute they make them up entirely okay but you know it's interesting when you mentioned the the I was very popular
and and all those people love me I mean this
some of these these women
are there so
and a
she would every time she'd see me like I'd
the theater or something it's just you have to be on the show again come on come on let's go I love you do you love me that episode where people should watch that episode just to see what we're talking about like I said we don't want to get a copyright strike so we're not going to put it up but if you watch the episode it's bananas it's like an alternative universe and it's only like you gives you a hug and a kiss
she writes me a letter you're the greatest president she leaves you know she worked as like an assistant press secretary I hardly
but she leaves and she writes me this gorgeous letter
what's your name she was
sister in the far right hand side whatever the hell his name is and
and she writes a letter the most beautiful letter she's quoted in the
he's a consequential he was the greatest president by
then all of a sudden she goes into you she start hitting the hell
because they won't hire unless I've had many people go on CNN and they call it said I don't know what to do
they want to pay me a lot but I have to be negative and you should be negative that's okay there are guys on like CN
they won't hire
Shaun d
is it in a congressman
retired you got a good job with CNN but he was only positive about Trump
so they kept him
but they would never put him
I mean I respect what he did he could have gone you know negative I tell people
go negative let my friends make the money it's so crooked the president of themselves they are killing all their credibility and it's opening up the credibility to New Media it's open up the credibility to Independent Media
I've been a part of it I've been I've seen
Kamala goes on 60
gave an answer that a child wouldn't give it was so bad
in 60 minutes
took the answer out they took the
and they put another answer in which didn't make sense either but it was better
they took the what was an editing it was fraud it was not editing you know editing is
I'll give an answer and I'll take a couple of words and change around or they might even take a sentence or two off which is very bad but
which was a very good answer I always talking about you know
I like to give long The Weave yeah you like to leave but when you do the waves and you have to be very smart to do with when you do the weave look at this just in this one thing we're talking about a little pieces on here but it always ends up it comes back home for the right people it doesn't come back home when they end up in the wilderness right but
but they can
my answer and you know what they may take a little piece of it
and they use the term yes we want to save time well it's not
I'm never heard
I think it's the biggest Scandal on a broadcast history what happened to CNN C
so you have CBS 60 minutes that's a news program it's not an entertainment program it's under the news it's the head of their news
she gives an answer that
that shows that she's essentially
and they took the answer could you imagine them doing that we can show it if you want people to see it we get in trouble we'll get copyright
interesting was the other full version was available initially it was like a preview somebody made a big mistake somebody put that preview put the preview on and then the bosses said we got a problem and then they got cut by mistake
this is election interference and
and it's 60 minutes it's the news division
for free
they should pay a Fortune they're worth a
they give them out for free because they're using the public are
with cable you don't have that cable
but
it's just a different deal
but with the networks they give those lights they're worth billions of dollars to give him a free but you have to be honest
that was bad I think that David Muir and that woman that was a side I never even heard of her but they kept interrupting me it was like I said how many people on my debating here I got this one and I got you
but he went after me 11 different times you know it's interesting
I always thought it was a nice guy but he's just like the rest of them you know well that's his job unfortunately and I'm sure that they want well the problem was that was when she said that there is there are no troops right now deployed in war zones there's a very famous viral video that went online of troops in a war zone saying well what the fuck are we then
because there's thousands of them Dan Crenshaw the congressman posted on his Instagram all of the various examples of troops that are deployed thousands and thousands of troops that are currently the point is if this is going to be an actual real debate and not a propaganda exercise it's going to be a real debate you have to fact check everybody
it's either it was
not true it was a lie on purpose which is terrible or it was the opposite it was ignorance which is also terrible when I said crime is soaring
he said no no crime has gone down
I said where did you hear that one crime has gone down I mean I'm debating with this guy
there was amended FBI statistics that came out after that that showed the crime had gone up substantially by the way the statistics were fra
because when they put out the statistics they didn't include some of the worst places they didn't include some of the worst cities some of the most deadly places
because people have lost the morale that the police department has in a lot of these cities where they've done is defund the police bulshit these the morality these four cops it's fucking horrible it's the dumbest idea of all the time but what they've done is they've they've made these cops feel terrible like good cops I think cops are just like everybody else most of them are
it's like everybody else but if you run into one Carpenter and he does a shity job in your house he said Carpenter's fucking suck but they don't suck
most of them are great and then
they they did all of these things in this very foolish way and these cops are suffering the consequences of it and so subsequently what happens is a lot of crime is unreported a lot of crime
you call the cops they're too busy they can't even get to you or your house got broken into sorry you know it doesn't even make a report there's a lot of people that they just give up
it's so sad what's happened and I'll tell you what I go
police
and we went to one in Long Island I visited the family in Long Island the very big deal
it's so dangerous people don't
dark
pull
is a gentleman please pull over door open sky comes out
even if they were allowed to pull out the gun which they're not they can't do in time they open the door
and he was killed and his partner was
he was
I mean you don't even have an eighth of a second to
and it is such a dangerous job that in particular think of it you go up to a car you don't know who's sitting there with a gun and if they have a gun you really don't have a chance you're not allowed to have your gun out by the way you have a very strict
but even if you could have your gun
the door opens in bullet start firing and especially where they have the dark Windows where they have the darkened window
it is such a dangerous profession
that is very hard to get cops
because they're not giving any
and you're
you can you know they have like an eighth of a second to make a decision that's going to change their
if they make the wrong decision they going to end up on the front page of every newspaper in the country
and they going to lose their house and their pension and their job and their wife is going to be gone and everything happens and there's nothing that people don't talk about how many of them have PTS
a lot of cops are deeply depressed
we just have to give her back you said it's so good you never hear anybody say
you're never going to have it perfect you're going to have a bad apple in everything and every profession but every time there's a bad apple that gets massive publicity and
defund the police get rid of the police you know even comma Harris is a part of that
you should have some something that helps mitigate this PTSD to all of them suffer through she was a big part of to find the place that was a big thing for her to find the place always to fund the place
what was the political idea with that political thought I don't think she should be running for president and I think people are getting wise
you know we're doing pretty well now I don't know maybe in a week from now say sorry about that I was wrong but we're leaving everything
and I think we're going to have a very good election but I tell people because people are starting to get to know
but she was defund the police she was the oldest transgender operations you know if you wanted a sex change and you were in detention and you demanded a sex
they would give you a sex change will the wildest one is this idea of giving free sex change to illegal immigrants
in debt
so think of it
change 15 Pollock in fact I'm going to send her a mega cab she's still your idea about no tax for tips
I came up with this idea but honestly nobody ever heard
but now we have a lot of good issues you know we had the other day I think of how simple some of these
we're trying to get cars built in the United States Detroit has been really tough It's been a disaster
they have a huge factor a huge car auto plant being built by China in Mexico make car sell them in the United States put everybody out of business right here we
I said
what plant is there when I'm president I will put
100 or 200% tariffs on every car they'll be unsalable in the United States
and they just announced they're not going to build the plan because they think I'm going to win think of it they're not going to build the
this was the biggest plant in the world
it would have more than all of Michigan makes that's how big you know this is
we getting
if that plan goes up I want them to understand if I win
I'm going to text those cars at the rate of 100 or 200% a piece so that you won't be able to sell them in the United States they just announced they're not going to build the plan I did a big favor
4-Hour country by doing that and I'm not even there yet
to me the most beautiful word I've said this for the last couple of
in the dictionary today
is the word
it's more beautiful than love so beautiful
it's the most beautiful word
this country can become rich
with the use the proper use of tariffs it will teach you just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes and replacing it with tariffs about that because we ready how our country was the richest in the relatively in the 1880s and 1890s
a president who was assassinated named McKinley
who was the Tariff King he spoke beautifully of terraces
language was really beautiful
we will not allow
the enemy to come in and take our jobs and take
factories and take our workers and take our families
unless they pay a big price and the big price is tariff
and you speak like that but he was right
and then around in the early 1900s they switched over stupidly to frankly an income
and you know why because countries were putting a lot of pressure in America we don't want to pay tariffs please don't you know
believe me they control our politicians
if you look at the kind of numbers that these guys
then and
we had a commission meeting in the
I think it was 1887 think of this problem
we were so rich we had so much money we didn't know what to do so they set up a blue rib
Commission on tariff
in the sole purpose is what to do with all the money we had
we were so
because we were taxing other people for coming in and taking our
if you want to open a factory and
cuz if you build a factory or have a factory they don't take our cars they wouldn't take our cars but if you
a plant in China
you can do that Elon did that by the way Elon is great that guy is such a great guy I think you're a fan of
he is from a different planet he's the greatest guy that rocket coming in I told the story once or
did you see the one last night 29000 people that was a and the one the night before was the same thing we are we are rocking and rolling
but Elon I'm talking to this very important guy
I said wait a minute I'm looking at something the television is on muted
can I see this rock
Brown from the heat you know 10000 degrees pouring down a thousands of miles
and I see this thing and it's like a 20 story building and it catches and I say to this guy's an important guy
let me just put you to hold I got to see this
and I see this and it's going to crash I said it's going to crash into the Gantry they call it
oh man that's going to be a disaster cuz it's starting to get very
and then all of a sudden you see the flames and a bottle of
and then you see the two arms
and I said who else can do that he said nobody rush you can't do it the United States nobody can do it
you know I set up space force that was me and that's the first time in 82 years that we opened another Branch since the Air Force
and that's going to be one of our most important things but think of what Elan does and he did one other thing that I never heard of it it's
I went down to North Carolina Georgia the different places right now I followed it right
and they had no communication the polls were all knocked down
and one of the guys in North Carolina said could you
do me a favor do you know Elon Musk is he endorsed me by the way he gave me the nicest endorsement to the the tough he said the country is going to fail you should do the same thing
because you cannot be voting for Kam
without speaking to you I think I know you maybe almost as well as your wife
I have watched you for so many years you're not a camel a person
you're a khabib person but you're not a common person nobody's going to know who could be is
they
could you get him but we need starlink and I
Elan he got it for him so fast save so many lives
and I said how was it they said better than the wires you know they couldn't put them in they were all they were
we're spending just to show you
we're
a trillion dollar
to get cables all over the country
up to Upstate are
will you have like two farms and they're spending millions of dollars to have a talk about a million dollars that was wasted on this Internet access program the United States they didn't get anybody they have access to Internet
with that kind of money for almost nothing for a monthly charge it would have been incredible internet everywhere you want to go and he wanted to do that and he wanted to do the Chargers stations
in the mid
play Midwest they built eight
because
billion dollars that's like a gas pump
they built 9 gas pumps except electricity comes
they spent $9 billion dollars three of them don't work the whole thing is so much waste I could I could sit here and tell you about things that
there's so much
abuse and fraud oh yeah I'm sure I mean I think everybody is aware of that let's get back to town when you're talking about one of the criticisms of your Administration was with tax cuts and with tariffs you increase the deaf
was the what was the strategy behind that and did you think it was going to increase the deficit by existential amount we were ready to
it was all good you know I had a bad system
horrible tax policy I made it
with a much lower tax rate so I took it from almost 40% down to 21%
now I'm bringing from 21 down to 15 but only if you make your product
in the United States
which is great people call me this is what a great idea nobody ever heard of that before I don't care if they make the product in Japan why should I give
so it's a 21
at
in the first year
we took in much more Revenue than we did it almost 40 think of that
it inspired now we had other things too we we were able to get people to bring back their money you couldn't you couldn't bring back your money if you had money
Europe like
applehead many billions of dollars outside they couldn't bring it there was no way to bring it back
the bureaucracy the documents the whole thing and also the tax was too high you know they wanted like half of it or something nobody's going to do that so they they leave that money
in Japan and they spend their money there
that was part of what I did
the money came pouring back in apple took in hundreds of billions of dollars they brought it back from overseas they brought it in so how does the deficit increase because of that so what happened to
we were ready to rock and roll and then we had to cover
and we had to focus on that
if we didn't give some businesses ahead they would have all you would have had a depression like in 1929
but we were ready to start we were going to we would have very shortly been paying off
you know we have 35 trillion in
and I'll never forget it we were it was talking about from you know the standpoint of being in
I'm in the Oval Office and I have John McLaughlin and Fabrizio the two very good pulses probably I don't know I would say the two best
but very good
and we're starting to think about running for a second
we had the greatest economy
in history never has there been an economy and you attribute that to lowering taxes and also I cut regulations more than anybody else
and if I asked many of the businessmen you know from the big companies you know the guys running the big companies
so if you had your choice you've had it now for a long time
what's more important to you
tax cuts you paid less tax or the regulation
every one of them said the regulation Cuts meant
who would think that right
cuz you don't have waited to dollars but it actually is more
we had it going and then we just had to focus on something else but it was so you know these two these two posters
we're sitting there and they
if George Washington came
add Abraham Lincoln was his VP
is it supposed to waltz how bad is he by the way
but if Abraham Lincoln was his VP
they couldn't beat
and I'll never forget it the following day
they said something's happening in China
could we
I said what's happening
people are Dy
and it was all around the Wuhan lab by
is there a pictures
little l
the body
all around
2000 miles
so we got hit with that and despite that we had the best economy and when I gave it over
the stock market was higher than it was pre covid I mean nobody could even believe
but we saved it
we were helping businesses they were dying so it's your belief that if you had a second term given the policies in place the way the economy was booming that you would have been able to pay off a lot of the debt and that was the strategy
we would have been paying off that and we would have
and don't forget by growth the word growth is actually more important in a way because you could have the same debt but if you double your growth all of a sudden you're under
but still we should pay off that you know if you viewed this
35 trillion dollars right now
but if you look at the asset value if you looked at a purely as an asset value
we have
oil underground we have water we have mountains we have the I mean the assets are so enorm
but regardless of that
I've got 35 trillion in debt we should pay it
and we would have started paying off debt and probably even giving further given further
tax reductions I want to get it down to 15%
we're going to do more business
but when you get hit with a covid everything stops and you have to keep these businesses alive the businesses were
are there influences outside of environmental that keep people from wanting to drill for oil and Frac and do those sort of things outside of the environmental concerns which are legitimate of course but influences that may be
over accentuate or over exaggerate these environmental effects are people being influenced in a way where they're trying to keep us from producing American Oil yeah
the environmental is the biggest tool for stopping growth the biggest
the other is regul
and if you speak to Elon he said the regulation now to send a rocket up to anywhere even if you do everything it's it's almost
it's becoming imp
but they use environmental in order to get people
not to do anything
and sometimes I say
you know I look at some of the I know the environmental so better because I had to build buildings in New York I had a bill I had to do environmental impact stud
and I would see some of these guys that had higher for a lot of money environmentalists that would get you through the process
and there be up in Albany that's the capital of New York and up there trying to make it tough
for guys like me
that were
because they get paid more money in other
I had one guy
highly recommended all you know I was good at getting permits I was one of the kings of I was always very good
but the environmental stuff was always hor
they could slow a project down 10 years 15 years I had a project in Louisiana build big LNG
it was for 14 years it was going to cost 18 million 18 billion dollars one of the biggest and like the Empire State Building laying down on the side times four
and the coast on the Gulf
what's the problem they can't get their environmental they had Environmental
permits that would fill this whole room up to the ceiling
and they said there was one mistake on one little line they wanted to do it all over again it's not going to happen
and I got them their
instantly
and they built the plant it's massive so when you're saying that there's people that are making money by making it difficult are you talking about lawyers electric protected about environmental Consultants environmental Consultants profit off of dragging out the process
how do you make a box and I probably do the same thing about with them to be honest with you I don't want to be honest with you how do they do that how do they make it let's say New York they go to Albany and they convince people that if you have a certain type of plant on the ground that's this big
in theory valueless that is a rare
and you cannot even touch it
you can't
go near it you can't put a building on it you can't do anything
or there's a little
and they
and you have to go by the standards of a lake I said no no that's a puddle oh you have no idea
Kaiser feeling a little puddles you have no idea what they do but they use it as a way to stop you this is a way to stop you and also is the way to generate money that way though and pay these people rely on them as experts because they're the people that they go to when they have to run these studies in the first place
yeah I think they may be had more they didn't have as much with me because I
get through them and I understood it
I've had I've done so many they call environmental impact study I did so much to build a building to build a building in New York is very tough you got to be very you got to deal with
financing
Union
all the municipal stuff Environmental
of all of it to me the toughest thing was the environment
because they could stop you cold with the environmental impact study stuff
can you do you hire a so-called expert they say sure he's the one guy he can get you through the Miracles of morass it's hor
they use it as a weapon they use it all over the country but there are legitimate concerns about environmental impact correctly about the BP oil spill there's a lot of things that do happen that are environmentally devastating and you want to mitigate that as much as possible I say are
and water remember
it costs much more to do things
environmentally plane China doesn't do anything
when Carrie goes to see
president XI of China
what she probably doesn't even get to see
but they look at them oh yes yes we will do oh yes yes we're going to do that no more call no more call just and then they approve 58 call plans for the next you know every they build a coal plant
but in 3.8 days
that stuff floating over China is right over the top of us same thing with the oceans
they dump
the garbage into the Pacific
if you take a little Cork and put it there
in about a week and a half it'll be in front of Los Angeles
we're picking up that GAR
so nobody ever talks about that
but in a way the bigger one is
the air is the current it's an amazing thing it's
flowing that way for a million years of long before we hung before the whole world
but we get to China you know they call it the China curse we get the China
is there better and there is dirty you know when I went there
I had a great relationship with President she we got along
and they treated me better than anybody's ever been treated same thing with Saudi Arabia number of them but
they laid
do you know they closed every Factory one week before I got there from within 200 miles that's like what Gavin Newsom did when G Jinping came to San Francisco and the day he left
but in a way that was a bad thing that he did because he
show me what a disgrace that was what a disgrace well this is the thing that like shows you how foolish a lot of these people that are running these cities think a lot of people that are running these states think it's it's foolish like you you're insulting the intelligence of the people that live in that City that are impacted by
these people just camping and needles and human feces there's an app that you can buy there's an app that you can get rather that will show you where the human feces has been documented in San Francisco it's a poo app
let me give you one
you may not know which I think you know everything actually as a student as a student of yours but
you know
Los Angeles
get proper amounts of water and it's unbelievably expensive and you might have a house in Beverly Hills
and they're actually thinking about rationing water can you believe
if I was in I was in the farm Court country with some of the congressmen we're driving up
and I say how come all this land is
bar
it's farmland and it looked terrible it was just Brown and
I said but there's always that little corner
that's so green and beautiful
they said we have no water
I said do you have a drought no I don't have a drought I said why don't you have no water because the water isn't allowed to flow down it's got a natural flow from Canada all the way up north of more water than they could ever
and in order to protect a tiny little fish
the water
get crowded into the Pacific Ocean millions and millions of gallons of water get
you got to see this we're driving up and I had never seen it before
it's the most it's like Iowa it's the most fertile land I was blessed with great land
Idaho for a potato right now but these they're just
you know some land is good for a potato some land is good for Corners the craziest thing I love the farmers are great they are the greatest and by the way they're getting killed right now they're getting killed because of the stupid Administration but
so I see this and I said you got to be
I said you mean you have water and I looked at it it's like a valve in your sink except it's massive the things five times taller than your ceiling did you know the center of California was a giant
how long ago did they do that
the center of California had a fucking enormous Lake in the middle of California they dumped it into the Pacific who knows what they did but whatever foolishness that they did led to the situation they're in now think of those dry forests that burned down all over you know the head of Austria said yes
it's a freshwater lake in the southern San Joaquin Valley United States historically
Tulare Lake was one of the largest freshwater lakes West of Mississippi show a photo of what it look like back then
that's a great sense so that's what it looked like look at that image another one go to the one on the third from the right yeah
that was an enormous Lake in the middle of California
yeah they
19
1983 oh my God
try a handful
all of the Warriors
all of that land would have more water the whole thing could be like that little pet shop literally I'd say I was with Devin known as a congressman and other Congressman we were going up I was visiting that because
they asked me to go up and visit their territory
it's so dry
so I looked into
what is the thing I got it done I got it done I could have water
all of that
water for your Forest you know you're far so dry as a bone okay dangerous is that water could be routed you know you could have everything not only Danger
billions of dollars a year they spend
forest fires and you know there's a case with the
they're not allowed to rake there for us because
you're not allowed to touch it when a tree falls down after 18 months it becomes very dry it's like you know like real firewood it's
you know a tree that's up these are all things
learn the hard way the easy
but when a tree is up it sucks water it's
I went to that the car they had a couple of horrible forest fires in California and I went I said you know you got a lot of trees standing yes they were healthy Tre
I said with his intense
a little bit on the bottom but they were going to be all right because they're soaking wet cuz they suck up the water
but when they fall they're like you know it's like lighting a match and you got to be able to clean do they call maintain you for us so it's with the head of Austria
he said you know it's a shame I see all those forest fires in California
and all they have to do is clean the forest
rake it up get rid of the leaves get rid of you know leaves that are sitting there for 5 years and then get rid of the Dead Fall and get rid of the trees that have fallen or
so many things this country by the way could you repeat that raking all the leaves
but in the meantime this is exactly but you could have
it was the Department of Commerce that needed the approvals but Gavin Newsom had
I got it all done nobody could believe it it was all done
I said I got
you got so much water
all you have to do is
and that guy didn't want
did he not want to sign because that would be a political victory for you I think no he didn't know I don't think so you know
he used
he's a great president and we got along we did we actually got along at that point
but I think somebody said you just can't continue to call him a great president you know they they do say
but we had it all done he didn't sign and then we got on to other things
every time I go to California you have so much water
they don't
I'm telling you people living in Beverly Hills they turn off the water same thing with the electric they want to go to all electric cars but they have brown eyes every weekend you know well right after they made the announcement that as of 2035 you're not going to be able to buy an internal combustion engine in California like within a month
they had some announcement asking people to not charge their
what's the current couldn't handle it I will terminate the mandated that will be done I would say in my first day maybe 2 days because you know
one of the things that when I've talked to people that have a real understanding of nuclear power what their position is it's probably the cleanest safest form of electricity that we can
the fears of nuclear power are really about a few disasters the Fukushima Three Mile Island
these are old systems and that they're much more capable now and they're capable of making even better
but it's a difficult political issue because you think
nuclear power you think Chernobyl that's what everybody does they have this connection they have the potential disaster relief well you're not supposed to enter the land for 3,000 years or something else I think it's worse than that I think that area is
going to be radioactive for probably longer than you can imagine but
the point is they're better at it now and that they could do it now and you can generate power in a way that you don't have to worry about these one of the most ridiculous things is electric cars being powered by coal-fired plant
green
well we do actually it's being held you know we have certain areas where we have great raw Earth Mater
and we're not allowed to use it because of the environment and we have areas in California that have incredible Raw
and they're not allowing and I'm going to open it up I'm going to let him
but how do you do that how do you do that and protect the environment because the environment is going to be protected you can do it you can make it like out of it okay we'll put back a lake I mean
something nice about like you can do things magnificently
all of those areas most of those areas
when they say go electric with the cars
China is going to be the one that gives us because all of those guys in Detroit are going to be out of business you got to make your electric cars over there we have a thing called
gas
and we have more oil and gas under our feet than any other Nation you know I had
in Alaska there's a find it's called an
I got it approved Reagan couldn't get it nobody could get it I got it all done it was amazing
they were getting ready to start DR
the equivalent they think of Saudi Arabia one of the biggest finds in the world was all set to
in Biden comes in his one of his first orders
we're not going to use it it would have been so good for the we could have supplied all of Asia
with oil and gas can you talk about money the negative was politically they didn't think it was good for them that's all that's all it was so you don't think that it's environmentally dangerous taking it from way down deep in the earth environmentally would have been fine so it can be done responsibilities
I think windmills are really disruptive when you talk about the environment they killed the birds
you want to see a bird Cemetery go under a windmill someday
that hasn't been cleaned out
with all the bird carcasses like massive amounts of weather outside in South Texas enormous windmill farm and it's gross it's dystopian you're looking in the left and the right now he sees these big spinning machines that aren't even that effective at generating electricity most expensive form of electricity is a wind
and then they start to rust and rot and you have to then they get abandoned by the people that built them because you have to get rid of all that material too when you replace those blades now you have a problem because you have to expose these enormous windmill
how do I say you can't bury them
I even questioned that but I'm not going to get into it but they say you can't bury them but so you have the blades
they come up this is what I meant they come up with this
the environmentalist dream is windmills
you know what happens to him after 5 years they start to run after 10 years you have to replace
did you have a look at certain parts of California where they have heavy windmills and they've been aband
and they're all different manufacturers in all different companies and they are it is the ugliest thing it looks like a graveyard almost a graveyard of windmills it's so bad it's put it in the ocean how about in New Jersey off the coast of New Jersey they want to build the people are going crazy not to build them but we have them the whales are washing up on your way so
in 50 years I had one whale come ashore now they had like 18 come in the last year what is the what is happening with the whales I've read about this well they say that the wind drives him crazy you know it's a vibration because you have those things that 50 Storey building and they're super sensitive to vibrations the wind is rushing the things are blowing it's a vibration and it makes noise
you know what it is I want to be a whale psychiatrist in
the whales freaking
yes something happens with
but for whatever reason they're getting washed up on shore and you know and yet the environment environment I think there's nothing uglier I see it in Scotland I see it all over the world
you have this beautiful Valley it's been there for
in Civilization thousands of years but millions of years
and all of a sudden you have these ugly windmills up would you replace that with nuclear what would you do well I mean I think there's a little bit you know we had some really bad
they did one in I think South Carolina
they do them wrong they build these massive things then the environmentalist
I don't want to go into a long story cuz it's too long for the show this show is too valuable to talk about concrete but they have hardened concrete it's number 12 concrete it's the hardest it's harder than steel it's in
they put up a wall in an inspector comes along those nope nope you're a quarter of an inch of the wall might be 8 ft
can you hear a quarter of an inch too short I'm sorry you got to rip down the wall you got it because you got to be poured continuously
1/4 of an inch I'm sorry I ripped out you can't rip it down this stuff you can't put a hammer you can't it's it's incredible
concrete technology is unbelievable what you know what's happening you think of that that's an example of Regulation at 25% of costing $25 billion dollars
and then one of them never got opened but here's the story
France does it France's largely nuc
and they built small little compact plants
and if they need more they build the same thing and they hook it up and they hook it
because they get too big and too complex and too expensive
and it is very clean
they say it's it's you know my uncle I had a great uncle who was a great genius just like
are the members of my family
he was a professor
at MIT
for I think 41 years he was the longest of when I was in the White House the head of MIT Princeton and Harvard came down to meet me
the MIT person said I have a book on your uncle Dr John Trump he was our longest serving Professor who is a great genius so do you know
and he had he knew everything about nuc
from math to chemistry to nuclear
and he said someday it's going to be the way to go but the problem is so dangerous in terms of War
Donald Trump and this was a long time Uncle John Dr John Trump he said someday you'll have a little Satchel at your
and you go into a building and you'll be able to blow up New York City I said Uncle John that'll never happen he's right you know that was the Powerball to other countries write like that was the problem that happened with India and Pakistan they got nuclear power and then they were able to weapon
the biggest problem in the world today is not global
it's nuclear
and we have idiots that are negotiating for us
we have a guy that doesn't make it past 4:00 and it's not because of age you know I know so many guys in their late 80s and they're better than the I said to one guy that I think you're smarter than you were 25 years ago I've known him a long time
he's 89 years old he's Sharp
I mean
Biden gives people a bad name cuz that's not an old that's not an age I think they said because I'm three or four years younger you know I think that's why they said they say his age it's not his age he's got a problem two major brain surgeries those are not good operations
apology to Native Americans
and that he said that's why he's headed out west like he's off the reservation so to speak
for lack of a better term you know it's interesting because doing the Deb
I was looking over I'm saying this is strange it's just like strange things are happening yeah but he couldn't keep it together but do you think they knew he couldn't keep it together do you think that they wanted is that why like historically that debate was earlier than they've been in the past right
I think they wanted to get well there's a lot of theories a lot of people said
do the debate now and we'll get him out right I think that maybe could be well that is what happened so I think they also said do the debate now and get it over with
I don't think anybody thought he was going to get out really the debate the debate got him out but but I think it's very unfair
do you have a bad
his numbers went down
but I think she's not doing very well right now and I think she looks
like the whole pole thing is very bizarre for most people because most people don't answer
so they read the pause Chromecast
so I really don't believe too much
so will 2016 taught a lot of people about the ineffective
3040.000 people Hillary would go they have 500 people and they tell me I'm going to lose I said why am I going to lose at 40,000 people she had 200 people
but you know I have a theory these pulses they charge you a lot of money to you know they charge you half a million bucks to do some stupid Paul in the interview like 251 people
in many cases I don't want to get myself in too much trouble
I think they sit there they make a deal they got a half a million bucks and they say Trump's leading 51 to 49 they announced it everybody says oh
do you understand I don't think
I think in a lot
I'm a very common sense person I think that they probably
don't always pause some of them probably never
what's the difference between 4951 and 47 1/2 what's also a tiny percentage of the population I don't think it's representative of the overall population I just don't know if one person in my whole life that ever got caught by a pulse exactly that's my point
here's here's my question but I shouldn't say that cuz I'm doing very well in deposit I think so this week I happen to believe in a verse I only believe
I like them this month but no I honestly believe that this is probably a lot of fraud I had a pole Washington Post ABC in the Hillary
one Wisconsin they had me down 17th
I know it was wrong because I had a rally I had 29,000 people at a racetrack and it was like 0° Wisconsin
and they had me down 17 poyntz in other words you had no chance
and I
and I called up my posters good guy good good good guy and I believe he's legitimate and you know some of them are some of them
I said tell me why did they have me down so much I mean
nobody's going to believe them the next time they said they don't care
when you're down 17 points people are going to stay home they're not going to vote because they're going to say I love Trump but I'm not going to waste my time it's cold
I said but what are they making four or five he said at 4:05
is it going to go and vote at 17 they're not going to go to work so think of it I was the Washington Post ABC
I was down 17 poyntz in Wisconsin and I
it's crooked stuff there's a lot of crooked stuff and I wanted to talk about that too because one of the things that people
talk about with you is the denial of the results and I think JD Vance did a brilliant job the other day when he was being interviewed and they asked him did Trump lose the 2020 election and he turned it around and said was their legitimate election interference in suppressing the hundred by laptop story on social media
and was that a concerted effort well they say 10-point difference and I lost by
1/10 of a pint what is they say it was 22,000
and by the way I think he was a great
do you like JD I like him a lot to say that again and I think his ability to talk like a normal human being you did my friend Theo Vons podcast and he just did it how did he do it he's just talking about no no no I was about to
it's not like some of the wrestlers some of the UFC fighters like a Top Shot
the point of the bullet was over the years but you see the the things take it off a little bit
but it makes me a tougher guy you know the fighters you know the fighters love their you know Bo nickal is a great father how's he going to do I think he's great he's almost like undefeated college yeah he's a fantastic wrestler and one of the best mixers
oh that's going to be an inch after the election
so I'll leave the go as president or I'll be depressed and I won't bother to go but I really think they're having a fight one of the things that was fascinating also was the denial of the election results is is a pretty common thing Hillary Clinton famously denied that she called you and illegitimate president and she said that Russia put you in place of the election because she was
yes and it was a thing that was pretty common for people especially Democrats to deny the elections there's been many of them the Bush Administration the you know the dangling Chad's well look at these guys in Congress all these sleaze bags in Congress had a Democrats they're still denying 2016
but now they don't so much because you know they try and pin it on me you don't hear him say they denied it right up until the end my point is
this idea of election fraud is a forbidden
and you get labeled an election tonight it's like being labeled an anti-vaxxer a few questions some of the health consequences that people have for the covid-19 shots oh my God your auntie you're an anti-vax
if you say and what I say publicly and I've said this a lot
it's not 0%
so if you ask me what is the amount of election fraud in this country is it 0% no one thinks it's 0% I've never met one person
not a super liberal Progressive far-left person or a right-wing conservative not one person thinks it's 0%
they think when you have human beings and also you have a lot of weirdness
that was going on during the 2020 elections particularly with mail-in ballots and you had legislators that had to approve and they didn't approve and they went out and did it anyway
and you had you had old fashioned ballot screwing I mean you had
do you have people going up and dropping in phony votes you had unsigned ballots Etc
you know I'm for taking tests
I think anybody that runs for president should take they should give him test and it's not an age thing it's not based if you look back on History 70s and 80s your greatest some of your greatest leaders in the world world history long time world history
they were in their 70s and their
but I think you should take cognitive tests I think everybody they say it's unconstitutional
you've been a celebrity for a long time and you understand what this is
but for someone who's in her late forties who becomes the vice president who runs for president becomes the vice president and then all the sudden the weight of the world is on your shoulders and there's all these people pay a lot of people clam up but you need to have any you don't correct
this is an interview we've covered a lot of territory right and you know it's fine I don't care
I want to I think it's much more interesting
sheet to do an interview with
Anderson Co
a softball crazy softball
she took two days off and she started and studied all day long and then she comes out with the result that was a real embarrassment that was a really bad interview she couldn't answer a question
and every question is not answer
like what would you do your first day in office okay
I'll build a wall I won't build a wall there's a hundred things you can say just say anything
there's something off with
we're dealing with the smartest people
1.4 billion people with an Iron Fist and he's a brilliant guy whether you like it or not
are they go crazy
we have evil people in our country if you have a smart president he can deal with Russia he can deal with all of it I had a Russia would have never gotten into Ukraine if I were president how would you
automatic two things I told
I said Vladimir you're not
I used to talk to him all the time
you're not
I can't tell you what I told him
because I think it would be inappropriate
but someday he'll tell you but he would have never gone in but you know why else he wouldn't have gone in oil prices at $40 a
wouldn't have allowed him wouldn't have given him the money to prosecute that war wouldn't have given him the money
I said it with president
I was with President she said it was almost the same
convers
with Vladimir with Moe
with President XI
B
it was almost the exact same conversation
I said don't do it he would have never done
the day I left they flew 28 bombers over the middle of
Thai
28
and it's the apple of his eye and the same thing with
it's the Apple Ukraine is the apple of his I used to talk to him I had a very good relationship with
he wouldn't have done it he would have never done
but he also wouldn't have done it because of the you know one of the reasons
what happened is number one he doesn't respect by at all
not even a little bit and who the hell
but he doesn't respect him but when he saw what happened in Afghanistan how horribly that was hand
number one you take the soldiers out last night first okay that was that big
and we had that thing sharted out and they weren't obeying us they
Abdul is the head of the tal
bum bum headed all
some he didn't do I said
did I do what you got to do them
this guy took immediately took all he left the equipment behind
13 soldiers dead but he took everybody
he took his soldiers out before
a child would know that's what Millie was so stupid he was such a stupid guy
does General should have all been fired the AF
the people that were involved with Afghanistan
should have all been fired then they'd be writing books about him how stupid he was that bad
you take your soldiers out last
I had a big rally and I saw a child in the front
about a year and a half ago and I called the child up I said you mind if I borrow your
hell yes please and they came up
I gave him a quick details you know I said we want to get out of this place
then we have this and we have this and we have the equipment I gave him a little
I said do you take your soldiers out first
or last after everything's done you take them out last
a child would know
we took our soldiers out first and we left the
lower billions of dollars worth of equipment in military vehicles that are used for the best equipment you have to embarrass us the best equipment in the World Cups and Blackhawks flying is the craziest thing I've ever seen we left the best equipment in the World Behind what would you have done differently
what number one we would have taken at just so you can go back a little bit further
I had a couple of conversations with AB
and from the time I had those conversations cuz they were shooting our soldiers you know with the sniper
they were shooting a lot and they were shooting a lot with Obama much less with me but they were shooting
and I said get this guy on the
the Press went nuts when they hear
I had a great conversation with it was a tough conversation
18 months later there wasn't one soldier that was ever
and even Biden admitted it in a moment of stupidity cuz he shouldn't have made it his people what nuts
yeah well I will admit no Soldier we didn't have a soldier killed in 18 months in Afghanistan
not one soldier was killed because he understood
what was going to happen
if that
I didn't have one so then when I left
after having gotten more votes than any sitting president in the history of the country and much more votes that he got in 2016
when I left
they started shooting our sold
but more importantly what they did is
they did that whole thing with you know leaving he shouldn't have left number one should have left from the background cuz Bob Graham says massive
it's got tremendous acreage around a tremendous it's a very big it was built many years ago
and part of the reason you wouldn't have taken that is because it goes to China
1 hour from where China makes its nuclear
you should have never left
number one they should have left from
they should have left last they should have got you know we have Americans that are still there
they should have taken all their equipment down everything should every plane every screw should have been taken out every
and I said that that's when I realized that Millie was a dummy I
we're leaving but I want to get everything out search cheaper to leave it I
he said it's
you're not more dangerous
you just said
I said I want every plane I want every tank I want the goggles save night goggles they have all this stuff that these guys now
he said
it's cheaper to get out and
I said so you think it's cheaper to leave 150 million brand new airplane in
then it is to fly it out with a tank of jet fuel and put it
Pakistan or just flying directly
it's cheap
I said this guy's nuts I'm telling you he was so stupid he was so unwise he was like an unwise man
and there were a number
but I defeated Isis with the greatest generals I had a guy who was so
I Flay
the real generals not these idiots that we deal with
we knocked out you know I defeated 100% of the Isis
they said it would take 5 years I did it in a matter of a few
literally a few weeks
and we hit them hard and
so we're going to head up here we're going to hit him there we're going to head up here
and I said this guy's great I like this
I was told it would take 5 years that's why I went
I said how could I take 5 years we have brand new Fighters we have the best planes the best weapons the best guns the best bombs how
possibly take that
and I flew
I
left at 3:00 in the morning nobody knew I was going I got an Air Force One are we started flying
and when we reached about half an hour away from
that was where the airport was big Airport
about a half an hour away they said sir I'm sorry you have to turn off all your lights
we're getting close to our site I said give me we
8 trillion dollars that we can't leave the lights I think of this
20 years 8 trillion dollars and we can't leave the lights on in
I said that's okay turn the lights on I'm not going to fight him this one this is because it's too dangerous it's too dangerous because they see the light up in the issue
I said turn the lights
Denise said she will also pull your Shades if that's okay so that's what the plane was Pitch Black all the lights outside you know the blinking the blinking Reds they were all turned
and I like to sit with Pilots a lot of times and these guys are specimens I always
better looking
Tom
okay and they're even
I like perfect specimens these guys like for a fighter you know you have some guys that are perfect specimen
and you know they picked they picked the best pilots in the Air Force United States Air Force to fly Air Force
and I get up there
obsidian and I'm feeling my way up you know it's up by the 7:47 so you go through the stairs but I sort of knew my way
there wasn't a light in the plan I'm saying can you imagine
trillions of dollars
which on the flying
but I got into the plane the cockpits dark
little tiny light you could see the
perfect looking human being his co-pilot everybody was perfect they were all like movie stars you know it's like I could have cast a movie with these guys and nobody would believe it cuz they were too good looking
there will be landing in 10 minutes and I look
this is not a light and I'm saying you know I've landed a lot of plan
and you see like little lights
there's
and I said okay Captain good but I'm looking
did you been in many plants where it has the computer so I'm saying 1,000 ft 9 goes
800 it's a computer voice but it sounds like but it's incredible
700 is it Captain are we okay
are we okay captain
you said Sarah was fine no problem sir
I don't see the lights up there
sure we're okay
so I mean I'm exaggerating a little bit no problem with exaggerating he'll tell the story just a trump was a cow
stop setting weather
500 for and I'm sick and I'm telling you there wasn't a light on the Run
and we're going
you okay kept everything good yes sir no problem we'll be down in about 1 minute
and I'm telling you
there's not a little
and all of a sudden
can you hear blah blah perfect land I like
between the equipment and it's genius it's
it was so dark you couldn't see a thing that was no Runway you wouldn't know where the hell you're in the middle of a
and then I got out of the plane I said thank you Captain it's a great
and then I got out of the plane
going down and I see a
add another
and I see a staff sergeant the drill sergeant in a various
call Central
Central
I don't want to rest I want to figure out what the hell are we doing with Isis I'm here we can't it's going to take years
now say we can do it very quickly
anyway we going to the room we
I mean Biden would have taken a nap for 4 days and then left without a
can I say how long can you do it how long we can do it in a couple of weeks
what's the weather today tell me 5
we can do it in and he gave me a
like in
I said why haven't you done it because the
came in from Washington Sarah and they would come here and tell us what to do don't you challenge
we're not allowed to do that sir that's not the military way they tell us what to do and we have to respect them I just so do you think that it was incompetence why they didn't go after Isis you know when Madison goes there who's stupid and they tell these guys that are actually smart what to do
are the guys that are smart are saying we don't like what they're doing but they're not allowed to sort of counteract plus the guys that went there are arrogant you know they're arrogant fools they're like stupid pho
the way they pulled out
you know the way they as an example
the way they pulled out of Afghanistan with the people falling off the plane it was so it was it was worse than Vietnam with the helicopters it was so bad there was no reason for
anyway so we knocked them out
I mean we have great military we have great people but
not the television guys and I rebuilt the military and then they gave a chunk of it now you have to as much as it is it's a tiny little piece Believe it or
do we have an I rebuilt the military I rebuilt our nuclear
and in a way I hated to redo it but I got to realize
how powerful that nuclear is Joe
Israel is gone but
one Bob can take out the entire East
it's so bad
can I watch these poor fools talking about
are Russians will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 500 years
we have people we have countries right now you're five countries
and don't underestimate
if you take a look at North Korea
I was there I mean I was with Kim I had a great I got a long night with him you know the person she got along good that's a good thing it's not a bad thing it's a great
Obama thought we were going to go to war with North Korea when I met with Obama just prior to the Takeover you know you meet you have a sort of a ceremonial
but it lasted a long time a lot longer than it was supposed to last I said what's the biggest problem he said north
by the time I finished I wish we would have no problem with North Korea we were really it was a little tough at the beginning remember he said I have a red button on my desk I said I have a red button also
but mine's bigger than yours and mine works I like how you call them little rocket man I said I said Little Rock I said little rocket man you're going to burn in hell and it was a
this is crazy and then one day I got a call sort of like a
I got a call you know you have to say that pounding from then all
but I got a call
and it was from him meaning his people they wanted to
they wouldn't meet Obi
he tried to me they wouldn't even talk to him about
and I think he expected to go to war I actually do I believe he expected
and we checked the nuclear stockpile it is substantial I mean it's that's I said you do anything I got to know very
I got to know better than any
why don't you go take it easy and relax go to the beach you're beautiful beach nice beach run propert
just relax you don't have to do it
let's build some condos on your Shoreland I actually have Gorge
and he said
I just have to do it because I need it for my safety it said I got to know him very well we had no problem with him if you have a smart problem if you have a smart a really the right president a smart president
you're not going to have a problem and I say it to people
we have a bigger problem in my opinion with the Enemy from within and it drives them crazy when I use that
but we have an enemy from within we have people that are really bad people
that I really think want to make this country unsuccessful
when you look at what's happening at our border Joe when you have people coming in
when when other countries are allowed to empty their prisons into our country with murder
we are 13,099 murders
dropped in our country over the last 3 years
in 15,000
convicted rapist drug dealers drug laws for
people from mental institutions what do you think the strategy is hundreds of thousands of major criminals
tougher and worse than anybody we have these are the consequences of in San Antonio they're taking over apartment buildings in Aurora Colorado they take it over apartment
these Venezuelan games what do you think the strategy is you know one of the things that they've said is that you stopped a bill
from being passed but didn't that bill also include amnesty for the people that already here this is years after the
the damage was already done but what was the what was the problem is it allowed 2 million people
they were going to get amnesty it was a horrible bill it didn't protect us at all but we should just tell people about the strategy is so one of the things I do think it's been very clear is that they've moved a large percentage of these migrants they're coming across the border illegally they've moved them
two
this is what's going on with Springfield Ohio right now
it's called Springfield Ohio to be exact and Springfield Ohio
is this very nice
a 52,000 people
that
32
migrants that don't speak the language
dropped into their
you can't get into a hospital you can't get into a school
it's gone from a beautiful little place to a hore
and the mayor is a nice guy and the mayor
we're looking for interpreters
I said
you've got to remove them and bring them back to their country mostly Haitians in this case
but they speak no they speak no language they speak
no English
in fact even the language they do speak it's I mean they can't get interpreters they can't do anything and the man is trying to be politically correct they're all trying to be in Aurora Colorado
you have the the worst probably the worst gang MS-13 might even be you know those two are the worst gangs he's a Venezuela
they have taken over
apartment complexes and they're going to want to take over the whole thing
and you have a weak Governor pathetic governor
who's a radical left Democrat he doesn't know what the hell to
but you have many other communities but they don't like to talk about it because it's you know it's bad for the community to talk about
these people have been let in
play this imbe
I mean she's a low IQ person
the app that used to be used it used to be used I think essentially wasn't it for shipping
the cartel heads of the cartel rich people by the way these are loaded these people have so much
they would call
think of this they call up the app
and the app tells them where they should take
their load of a legal migrants from
the Cong
do you know we have a lot from the Congo prisons and the
I made a little bit of a sarcastic joke a man named Dana White who you love who I love I assume you love
I think he's in a class by him he's probably the reason why
I I
he's one of the
he is the greatest guy you know I always say every nobody's indispensable you know everybody can be replaced maybe you can't be you might not be but
do you know what truly I don't think
do you know the things to Desoto for 4 billion
what are the who the hell is going to pay 4
and they made like a great deal of take him out I think it's the best guy he spoke at the whole thing with you know I just been shot
he got up and he spoke so better than anybody
I mean who would be better to introduce you I asked of all the people and I know the biggest people in the world and they all would have loved to have
how do you say Dana would you do it it was interesting he was
and he said to the people that you know one of my guys called
I won't be able to do it I'm sure I just left with my wife and family
I was a little surprised even though I know he was very far away he was in some place some you know and he deserved it with his family and all
and all of a sudden
should Dana White just said he's going to do it and he's coming back in tonight he's taking it you know the guy is just an incredible guy and
he's like a
Champion put loyal yeah he's got to be one of your favorite people I've been friends with him for 23 years so would you have cuz you what you're doing here is incredible I mean everybody tells me all I know is today I'm going
do you know you're on Joe Rogan take before tell me like
I said how the hell do you know that but it's it's sort of what you've done here is amazing
where would you be if you didn't do the UFC stuff would you have this show do you think I'll still be doing it for sure would it be at the same level I don't know
I'm involved in so many different things
you know stand-up comedy UFC and all the interest that I have that lead to the podcast will you always want to do you first of all you love UFC I love it you love the fights I mean I want you you are loving it they could pay you nothing it'd be very they didn't pay me anything for the first like 13 shows I did it for free because they were hemorrhaging money
and I became friends with Dana and my my position was you're going to give me the best seat in the house I get to sit cage side for the
I think these are the guys that we had always hoped for
1997 I was the before the UFC was purchased by zuffa which Dana worked for so I was a part of the previous owners
and I only did it for a couple years it was just too much and I was losing money and it was banned from cable because of Budweiser and John McCain and you can only get it on DirecTV and so then I came along and I gave him the size and he never forgot it he loves you for that you know
because it was too dangerous everybody was against it and they couldn't get
and I gave
the first two or three sides and they were
and by the way I went to the first
I said I never saw anything like this it was crazy it was so good take the best fight you've ever it was like that fight
it was so good
but you know
when I wasn't in
you probably never had a time but I had times when I wasn't exactly
Dana they called him he said he's the greatest guy there's nobody
he said
I'll never say anything bad about that guy because when I need it cuz I'm having a hard time at the beginning they almost pulled the plug a couple of times right
he said he stood up and he gave us stuff that nobody else gave us and nobody wanted anything to do
I will never and there was a time
where it would have been very popular for him to say bad stuff about me
he said the greatest stuff about me said you're going to try and get me to say bad stuff about Trump I'm never doing it no he's a very very bad guy very unusual guy he's a fantastic a perfect guy to be at the house or something so controversial is the UFC less controversial yeah well this was always the thing that I would hope that it would be I always knew that it was unbelievably entertaining but I just didn't know if maybe I was crazy
maybe I loved it because I've had this long history of being involved in martial arts and maybe like other people just think it's too violent but can boxing make it yeah boxing still a great sport I love boxing but it seems to be
so unimportant Now by comparison to UFC don't you think I think well you know Dana is working with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia they're going to start promoting now and with Dan at the helm of it I think boxing because
the thing is they want to make fights
that other people maybe you know promoters don't want to make because they want to protect their fighter controversial fights where you know it's dangerous like you don't know this guy could lose and so the Saudis they're smart they're just offer a tremendous amount of money and they're putting together fights that no one else can put together they're doing that in boxing if Dan is involved he'll probably make it good you don't be amazing
no UFC fighter they say has ever
and it looks to be much more violent
mini boxes have died isn't it interesting and Dana tells me because they take so many shots to the face and there's also no other options to preserve yourself to protect yourself so if you get hit in a UFC fight you can clinch you can try to take the fight to the ground you get options also you don't get allowed to get knocked down and then get back up when you get knocked down you're concussed and generally you know if a guy's really hurt they could be finished in on the ground in the fights over if it's boxing you have 10 seconds to get up you get up your head kind of trouble run away and survive until the bell rings they're only three minute rounds and then you start again so you're getting repeated punishment to the Head
weight cutting you know which is a problem with the UFC as well but weight cutting in boxing is led to if you look at deaths in boxing there's very few of them in the heavyweight div
most of the deaths in boxing of the Wide Awake divisions because when guys dehydrate themselves to to lose weight to make weight
their brain is the last thing that gets rehydrated
like it's very difficult to completely rehydrate your brain quickly and you only have 24 hours between the way in and the fight and it used to be the way it's where the day of the
like when when Boom Boom Mancini had a fight with duck who came and killed him in the rain which is one of the last ones on television that we've seen that was a crazy event for people and heartbreaking and it led to a bunch of different changes and one of them is day before Wayans to allow people to rehydrate better and the other one is they dropped it from 15 rounds down to 12
elect they should do that again you know
I'm not the fight
but those 15 round fights were unbelievable I'm available at the Championships those were the greatest hits by who do you think is the greatest of the fighters there's there's a lot of arguments for who's the greatest of all time you know Jon Jones
if most people would say is the greatest of all time never lost
it's certainly a really good argument for that there's another argument for Georges St-Pierre
I always leave in BJ Penn and his prime Anderson Silva and his prime you know mighty
people forget about Mighty Mouse because unfortunately he's a smaller guys 125 lbs flyweight Champion he's one of the greatest expressions of mixed martial arts I've ever seen I think to this day and khabib
if you looked at like accomplishments in terms of championship fights could be retired 29 and 0 but he didn't have as many world championship
play some tea about could have even got the decision in that fight I'd have to go back and watch it again to make a decision but okay the best athletes in the world and the most dangerous sport in terms of like it's I always call it high-level problem solving with dire physical consequences that's what fighting is you know I never forget
and I think it was
say George George say
I think it was him who did he fight Jamestown
Jamestown
once you got to the anchors back to announcer said it's over to sleep
the greatest of all time people forget about Anderson Silva in his prime he was Unstoppable
Fighters can only compete at that level for so many years and so my opinion you have to judge them at their very Peak you can't judge them when they're hanging on and still fighting you can't judge them when they're coming up you got to judge them in that championship
in that Championship Peak there's a handful of guys that you would consider at the very time they stopped a little bit sooner some of them would have had you know I mean there are a couple of that you just mentioned without mentioning names and they stopped at the perfect they were unbelievable and
at a certain age to start getting knocked out right yes it's unfortunate but the thing is that same belief in themselves that lets them become a champion who makes them think that they can do it long past the time that they actually can Anderson Silva was essentially unbeatable and then he lost it last one and then all of a sudden he's got knocked out by Chris Weidman he was kind of clowning in that fight famously and Chris Weidman had a vicious left hook knocked him out and then they fought a second time and he broke his leg on Chris wide mouth and after that fight he was kind of never the same because that that leg break injury which Conor McGregor have this quite a few Fighters ironically
you have to get surgery you have to get bolts and plates to keep your legs together and then it takes forever for it to heal
it always amazes me how the kicker I mean you have those cases
the kick it will do tremendous damage to somebody's
but their leg doesn't seem to get damaged isn't it what time is it hurts more than you you you you you you very numb after a while and guys that are really good kickers they're kicking the thigh in the kitchen soft areas and they're slamming this hard numb Shinn gets all these like microfractures and it's like
that's why you're good at work that's why nobody does this
without the enthusiasm
what has to be
like that I mean the only reason why I do MMA commentaries cuz I am very interested in it for real it's not I don't have to manufacture it I'm very interested so are you going in there after the fight and they're sweating all over your life like 2 weeks ago I never came out so back to you what what are you and first of all I love this idea of utme up with Robert Kennedy right and I love this make America healthy again idea because
there are chemicals and ingredients in our food that are illegal in other countries because they've been shown to be toxic
there's pesticides and herbicides and there's a lot of shit that's been sprayed on our food that really is unnecessary
and there's a lot of Health consequences that people are suffering from a lot of these things into because I had a feeling you'd be asking me look at this
these are healthier countries look what the United States is going to send this
RFK Jr
something along the I was actually talking to RFK today and he told me that more than 70% of young men are ineligible for the military because of their
the lights change the life expectancy versus Health expenditure
that's what that is what RFK is going to be very you know I think he's a great guy I think he's crazy and are you guys are you completely committed to have him a part of your Administration
the only thing I want to be a little careful about with him
the environment
because you know he doesn't like oil I love oil I guess I think you know I think it's keep them out of the fire so I'm going to try to keep him out I said focus on health Focus you can do whatever you want
but I got to be a little bit careful with the liquid gold you know I understand but listen there's plenty of good work that could be done if you focus on health so that is the one that my all-time favorite see the arrow right here that's when I left today I love you to not work with him have there been RFK Jr
yes yes I would
and you know
I think in many ways they've done a good job and many ways have done a bad job but I would say that the big farm
wasn't thrilled when they heard
can I have a relay I've actually always gotten along very well with him I've known him a long time
is a different kind of a guy is very smart great guy
and he's very sincere about this I mean he really is you know he
we we spend a fortune on pesticides on all the stuff and then you end up with that chart is a terrible shot the one previous
it's such a bad shot when you look at where we are compared to other countries that don't spend 10 seconds
I've had some people that aren't exactly thrilled
you can imagine it's a good question well certainly if it doesn't affect me some pharmaceutical drugs that have been prescribed that have negative consequences that these people have been profiting off of and then you have a guy like RFK Jr who spends an enormous amount of time highlighting those things you could say how they've been very reluctant to have you support
I would say that's an understatement what do you do to stop that from getting in the way they've come up with some amazing things I mean I don't know how you feel like I know you're against the next certain vaccines
I would like the polio vac
why do people have polio that were it was like a disaster
and they came up Dr salt and he came up with a vaccine and there's no Pol
now it's very interesting that hasn't been polio but now in the Gaza Strip can you believe that have you heard that
there's been a big strain of polio coming out in the Gaza Strip is it vaccine derived polio cuz you know there's there's a strain of polio that comes directly from the vaccine because unfortunately sometimes my vaccinate people from Heaven yeah
I mean all I can do is I sit down and I listened to him and I'll give it a total I would love him to be right
the dangers of the pharmaceutical drug industry one thing is when pharmaceutical drugs were allowed to advertised on television we're only one of two countries in the world that allow pharmaceutical drugs to advertised on TV the other ones New Zealand but they're more restrictive than we are
I would never say get me the closest things that are so bad they go through a whole list I guess they save some liability but
man I said does that affect the purchase of they say it really does
when they when there's something you have in you
and then they go through the list of side effects of potential side effects the potential side effects
I mean a lot of people
just I asked that question people hear that
when I hear it I'm going to take a piss it says may affect your vision may cause blindness may this yes but I know you're aware of calling Casey means right yes well what are things that they pointed out and this is a very important thing for people to understand is what a lot of these drugs do
is they they act
to somehow another mitigate the effects of poor metabolic
but most of these problems that these people are suffering from wouldn't exist if we put an emphasis on metabolic Health if people got healthier they started eating nutritious food and taking vitamins a whole host of these problems that people are having would go away
and the problem with that from the pharmaceutical drug standpoint is they wouldn't be able to sell drugs to these people
pesticides and things like that on the plants and then what do you think of that
well I think regenerative agriculture unfortunately is very difficult to scale to a point where you got a Jack In The Box on every corner if everybody wants food and we have food deserts and we have places like Los Angeles where no one's growing anything and everything has to be shipped in
and it's very difficult to feed that many people we've created this incredible Society where we have these enormous cities but it's in it's very difficult to get food to these people and then for a lot of these people in low-income areas the only food that's available is cheap unhealthy food and we could fix that that's if we can send 175 billion dollars to Ukraine we could do something to fix a lot of the health problems that the United States has
and I think it would it would help us as a nation overall it's just if you just put it out there that hey as a nation we're going to make a concerted effort to get people healthier just put it out there and people start making better choices well when you look at that chart it's crazy I just they just gave me that joke cuz they said you may want to discuss this topic which I know is a big topic
and when I looked at that chart and I looked at how unhealthy we are as a nation that's a that's a pretty big thing
is it
unfortunately is a big factor for health to some people are just way more robust but you do play golf a lot and that is better than my parents for me it's good
fresh air freshener outside even mentally your focused on that 3-footer and for a couple of hours you're not and I go quick I play Fast real fast and I'm in and out but you know it gives me I was never one that could like run on a treadmill I just and I can do it you know when passing a physical
they asked me to run on a treadmill and then they make it steeper and steeper and Ste
and the doctor said it was at Walter Reed
it's unbelievable I could have got I'm telling you I felt I could have gone all day but I said
doc I can do this all day long I'm not I have no problem
but it's boring to me do you understand
but I did it for so long they couldn't believe it that I
I have no problem doing it but it's really boring so with with golf or something you know or tennis or whatever
a golf as you get older there's something really good about it and you have competition competition and concentration and it's a great handicap sporting it gives you a couple of hours
if you're much better than somebody
you can't really play with somebody you know it doesn't work you can give them sort of the equivalent of Strokes right but it's not
with golf you can play with a lousy guy and give him a stroke a hole or two strokes a hole or something you know it's a good handicapping
but it gives me a little exercise but I haven't played in a long time I want a lot I want 32 Club championships did you play right after you got
know what I did
is I played with Bryson
do you know Bryson yes the pro
he's a great play
and we played it was a certain thing that we played I guess called breaking 50 or something 50 would play for a certainty and if you can break
and I got tremendous ratings sort of like a crazy thing it got your he's a great guy but he's a great couple
you know I feel very interestingly I'm running
for president of the United States to be such a big deal it's so important
so you down to two people
we start off at 9
could you have 9 billion they say in the world who knows what that
could you get down to 350 million sadly we have no idea what we have in this country but let's assume it's 3:25 350
can you down to two people what's the biggest thing in the world
and when I heard she took off yesterday and she took out the day before she's going to take off tomorrow or the next day
I haven't taken a day off in
6 days that's a long time I haven't taken one day
I don't
I didn't I don't want to play this is too exciting
is great but this is too exciting this is more exciting than anything you can do
it's the home stretch who would take a day
so we have 11 days left now
let's think of it so I think I've gone 54.55 days in a row no days
and I make speeches oftentimes you know sometimes not but I make spe
and when you make a speech
am I speechless last a long time because of the way if you know I mean I weave stories into it and if you don't if you just read a teleprompter nobody's going to
be very excited you got to leave it out so you would you say you always have to get right back to work otherwise it's no good but the weave is very very important very few Weavers around
it's a big strain on your you know it's a big it's a lot of
it's a
you got to be careful with the voice you can lose that voice your voice wasn't designed I said today so
I made a big one last night
I was in Las Vegas
got a big one the night before in Arizona
big one I mean they're all big we have the there's never been anything like it in terms of credit never been
never been close they
he talks about Craigslist you know it's very interesting
we get crowds
how do you say you know
I've never had a story because I don't get good rest I don't think I've had a good story in years I really don't I don't I swear I don't think you were talking about it a little bit with Oprah everybody loved me
I don't think I became president of the United States
I did great the second time I did much better I don't want to get you in any dispute
I want that second election so is he and not just because I want to talk to you about
I did that
and now I've gotten the nomination again and don't forget to get these nominations you go against very smart people Rhonda Santos was hot I got to go through
Nikki Haley was hot you got to go through her
I went to everybody record time record time I got three nominations in
who won the first time did much better the second time you know I get millions of votes more of the second
and now I'm doing it a third time
and it's incredible thing
I never get a good
I only get bad press now I will say this it's a lot easier if you're a Democrat if I were a Democrat you get a lot of positive I would get a lot of positive yes no it's a creepy crap business and the media to a large extent acts as a propaganda arm for the Democratic party yeah it's bizarre to watch and you know most young people that they are aware of it I think most Boomers still unfortunately read the newspapers and believe in Sienna
it's getting for us for a concert
do you know what I consider myself a Christian that they're not getting from anywhere else and they like the very fine people hoax
the Russian gate hopes all these different things they've done they try to pin on you that's like it's a clear Distortion of what you actually said I was talking about the Auto industry
is there a bloodbath because Japan and China are taking our order and I said it's a bloodbath they said he is the word blood vessels but that's the problem with propaganda because they take things out of context and of ultimately what they do is they diminish their own credibility because people don't want to listen to them anymore because they see that they've done that and they recognized what's going on and they feel insulted they're intelligence
do you know shows like yours
so I have a son is very smart and
bar
he knows all about you he knows about guys I never heard
is it that you don't know how big they are there babe I said who the hell is like Ross I Did he said that he's a great guy
I mean I said
it's a whole new world out there it's a different world now congratulations like billions of hits It's Christmas
30
a republican is always down 30 with young
I'm Plus
and I want to talk texting a lot of this bullshit young people are tired of being yelled at and scolded they're tired of these people that they think are mentally ill telling them what the moral standards of society should be today and people are upset it's a big difference now but even in just a couple of years
I was shaking hands with people that are young people the rebels are Republicans now
Pro silencing criticism their Pro censorship online they're talking about regulating free speech and that regulating the First Amendment it's bananas to watch their political opponents
I always say you're not a kid but I'm not kidding
I've been investigated more than Alphonse Capone he was the meanest of them all he'd kill you in 2 seconds if he didn't like you
I've been under investigation more than Alphonse cap
only because it's political opponent stuff and I want I want the big case in Florida I'm winning the other stuff
you win but you know what they did they did something that's only done in third world countries they came after their political opponent yeah I could have put crooked Hillary in jail well not only that but then it by saying that that's what you're going to do once you get an office right now what they're doing right now it's crazy
he's going to put us in jail he's going to
that's what you're doing to him a lot of people say will you do that
will you do that to him if he is to them if you win you know it's the president has tremendous
I could have put crooked Hillary I respected that you didn't because what you said was it would be bad for the country no I can't I couldn't even imagine you have
principal Secretary of State but more importantly the wife of the president of the United States of America
going into jail and if you ever saw when I say something about her they're all say I didn't say I never
they say lock her up locker and I always go take it easy just relax we're going to win this thing take it easy take it
and I'm telling you I kept it down just the opposite now they say oh Trump wanted to put her in jail
I saved her from going to jail they had more stuff on her and call me had it because when call me got up
any stupidly because he's a stupid guy too he goes to he's a stupid son of a bitch he got up Joe he got up
and instead of saying she's innocent of
he went over each charge
any charge was a Kill
Antigo and as far as her doing this
she's innocent and this and then she's only a unfair prosecutor for we go
every time you heard these char
play sounds so bad they
all it was is you wanted more airtime if you would have gone up and said
I've thoroughly investigated Hillary Clinton and she's done nothing that we feel is wrong it would have
instead he wanted to be up there cuz he's a he's
PR
he's a
any starts going through and you know what
they had a huge problem because FBI is
the people who had not the top people the people
the real people the people that work there is like the real generals that I told you about that defeated Isis in record
the FBI guys are great I'll bet you I'd be at 95% in the FBI
and instead of just saying
he goes to each church right now he was trying to protect her
but he did her a great disservice because he wanted attention so I want to I want to talk about 20/20 because you said over and over again that you were robbed in 2020 how do you think you were robbed everybody always cuts you off what I'd rather do is we'll do it another time and I would bring in papers that you would not believe so many different papers
that election was so crooked it was the most crooked election give me some examples of how well let's start over the top and the easy ones okay they were supposed to get legislative approval to do the things they did and they didn't get it in many cases they didn't get it what things
play extensions of the voting for for voting earlier for this all different things
by law they had to get legislative approvals you don't have to go any further than that
if you take a look at Wisconsin
they virtually admitted that the election was rigged robbed and
they wouldn't give access in certain areas
the balance because the balance weren't
they weren't Originals they were we could go into this stuff we could go into the balance or we could go into the overall I'll give you another one are you going to present this
like what do you do you think of Alexa
51 intelligence AG
come up
that the laptop
was from Russia
it turned out to be totally false 51 Former Intelligence agents right now they say that
I don't believe it's this much but it doesn't
I won by like I lost
22,000
1/10 of 1% less than that it's a tiny little
22,000 roster over that spread over the
51 intelligence agents lied they
daylight they knew it
it was Hunters it was from his bed it was Hunter's laptop
they said it was created by Russ
Russia Russia who was the
the Russia hoax was a big
but that's only one
and you can go into the ballots where they wouldn't give you access to the ballots you could go into the ballot harvesting you could go into 500 million for the lock boxes but just in terms of narrative so there's two things right there's the Russia
does the collusion with Russia that was never proven right that's what I know it's proven it didn't happen right right but but they talked about it to 2 1/2 years to prove but not only that but it was a constant narrative on television so that's a narrative that gets into people's minds especially low information people that just watch the news that you're in collusion with Russia so that's one so that changes the narrative and then you have the 51 Former Intelligence agents that work with the original Twitter and get them to remove links you can't share it on DMS you cannot share that story they swept that story because they said it was Russian disinformation even though they knew it was not so that's two examples that are real examples now anyone who considers himself a legitimate objective Observer of American politics if you really want the best person to win you would
want people to not
and the only reason why they got away with this lie was because they continually labeled you as this horrible threat to democracy and Hitler they kept saying you're going to be a dictator ignoring the fact that you weren't a dictator for the 4 years will you actually the president I was actually the opposite of a dictator I was a very straight guy but
those three things you take those three things each one of them by themselves causes the result to be different okay it does and then you can go into 100 other things there's so
we can't have corrupt elections and we can't have open borders we need a we need you need to have a country you need borders
you need Fair elections and I'll tell you the other thing you need
is you need a free and fair press one of the things I like about doing a show like this can you imagine Kamala doing this show
can you do the name should be laying on the floor and I hope she does I will talk to her like a human being I will try to have a conversation with you
I hope she does because it would be a mess should be laying on the floor comma and the Medics I think we'd have a fine conversation I think I'd be able to talk to her I wouldn't try to interview her I just try to have a conversation with her and hopefully get to know her as a human being that was my goal having her on trying to get her to express herself just as I don't know if these I don't think these formats are good I don't think that two people first of all I hate the idea of the presidential debates because I hate the idea of a Time limitation on complex ideas
I think you and Kamala you sit across the table with no one in the room but the two of you
of course you're not going to shout each other of course you're not going to answer me I mean it may get they used to do it but that would be the way to do it and the cameras on you with no no one interfering with pressed checking whether or not it's factual especially when it's biased because they checked you all those times and they didn't check her with clearly things that were inaccurate right so have two people just have a conversation without a time constraint
the microphone and no crowd no crowd crazy too because you're good at work in a crowd I would rather have of course I would rather than I had no so they gave me an alternative I don't think he wanted to debate it so I believe what they wanted to do is have me not accept
so they gave me a deal I couldn't
reviews
so they came to me they said
will debate Joe Biden anything that's tremendous ratings to that was crazy
but will the Beethoven but you can't have a crow
they also wanted sitting down I said that's the only thing I said look you got it you got to stand up you can't really sit down turn on the old days they did sit down a little bit but but he gets tired he got to stand
any agree to it was a very tough thing it almost killed it they wanted to they wanted to have like desks we
I said I think we should stand up and that was the only thing I asked for I said we got to stand
I thought it looked bad for like the public but they said no crow
and cut off
and I said I can live with it I mean I can live with it and they thought I was going to reject it and then they would say he didn't want to debate sleepy Joe said that you didn't want to debate her as well but by the way with her
number one I'm leaving number to you know I didn't they also said it with the primary
so I had
like 10-12 guys
in the primary no stupid guys I mean you know the state governors in the center they're not stupid people some are stupid but not all
oh my God I said you have to be in the debate I said
I'm leaving by 74 point
the closest guy to me I'm like 60.70 points High
why would I stand there like an idiot for 2 hours and let every one of them scream at me I'm going to be the focus
and I said I'm not debating and it was a very smart thing because you know
it was they just killed himself a Republican primary yeah the Republican primary
with I like debating I think I think you have to
I like debating like the Rosie O'Donnell
I like debating when you have a good remember the rosary is very funny making that was a hell of a question man if I didn't come up with that Instagram
what it was is you know that was we had 28,000 people that was the Cleveland Arena where the Cavaliers played LeBron James not a big fan of LeBron James but he is a good basketball player but you know
that was the and when I said that
that place when
it was it was a comedic time it was it was lucky
I did it because
she was she was in that question but she kept talking but you couldn't hear to this day they don't know what she said but it wasn't so anyway but we had a good time last night in front of a large audience music
play Tim wall stuff was very funny it's funny that's a real beat the she said that she had picked him and this one question I want to ask her when she was sleeping
she said she was suffering from sleep deprivation when she picked up
but can I bring 50 minutes
they're going to say they should have had a primary even if it was a short time they shouldn't have
and then she's going to say she had to pick this guy she shouldn't have picked that guy just the the about Tiananmen Square the military record assistant
I saw that and I actually got a call from your friends at Google
from Sundar that's pretty good
he said this is the biggest thing we've had in years McDonald's at McDonald's
who's the great guy by the way but
this McDonald's say I want to tell you it's one of the biggest things we've ever had on Google
it
but the reason I did and I actually you know you never know about this stuff I thought it was a throwaway I didn't think our conversations to throw away but I thought that was I thought I'd walk in and that was only to highlight the fact and I have a friend he owns like 56 of these McDonald's
he said you want to use what I said yeah I love
so we went there and the crowd was crazy you know they had 28,000 people around the whole thing did you see the outside it was crazy the cars couldn't get the secret service was not exactly thrilled we had no idea what the hell but I went into the place and I did the French fry
and it
put that's like in life sometimes you do I thought it was like a quick throw away we're going to be there for 15 minutes and I
I worked here for 15 minutes which is 15 minutes more than she worked here she lied about McDonald's and you know
is it proven that she never wanted to say
what McDonald's has no information no she has no information there's nobody the manager said she never worked there you know it was a certain place and he said they never know she
she's a liar you know what they do
they'll say like on any one of the questions take
they'll say it's the exact opposite of what I
I
he's against IVF fertilization and it's the exact opposite I was I came out immediately strongly
I'm against it it's
on every single
and you know she changed policies on 15th I have never seen a guy change anybody change on more than one you know you can maybe get away with
her whole life fracking every single thing that she was for
the confiscation of God she wants a conference and now she's saying everybody should have a gun in fact we're going to get her a magical I'm going to send her a mega
but she's
and I don't think people are buying it I don't think people are buying it well some people are buying it because they want to buy it cuz it's blue no matter who there's there's a certain percentage of our population that's going to vote Democrat no matter what that's true they're pressured their Community their ideology it's you know that is good right is evil I don't understand why okay
570 miles of wall
I built a lot of wall exactly the
but
what I don't understand
who would want people to come into our country
from places unknown like sometimes they'll say about a fighter from Parts Unknown
remember Haystacks Calhoun from parts that's even before you
who would want people to come
pouring into our country
we don't know anything about it but that's I want to ask you this why do you think they're doing that I think because you think they're trying to buy votes do you think I think what is the idea
they're
where they want to buy
it's one of those three things they want it now they are trying to get people registered to you know don't even know what the country and they're trying to get people amnesty people that live here they're trying to give us time to get some serious relationships the benefits that even our poor people aren't getting 200 million dollars and that's a way low number that's a way to it's interesting
and I'm sort of like always looking for
they've spent a hundred billion dollars on the stuff I don't know where they ended up getting the money from the federal government it's crazy
and because the Mets
came out and
we can't live like this the investigated
by the way I called
I said he just got himself
this group is stupid but they're vicious they're stupid people but they're vicious
directions to 120 elections you say you have all the evidence that it was rigged why haven't you put this evidence in a consumable form and what oh I did I have I have books on it and by the way
books have been written
we have an author named Hemingway
who is the great writer she wrote a book on
many books have been written on it there are books that
what's happened is judges don't want to
they would say you don't have standing they didn't rule in the merits they rule the merits never got there
The Judd
didn't have
to turn on let's talk about the potential vulnerabilities for elections and election fraud one of them is mail-in
the other one is the
if someone can break into voting
I think you said a public I hope he did because I wouldn't want to be the one but he's a
and he's a very good guy with computers right you'd say he's one smartest people alive anybody that can land at 20 Storey building and perfect
an amazing guy
he said to me
that unless you have paper ball
it can never be an honest election that's a
that's a big statement we should go to paper ballots you know France
they want the mail in voting and it was
what can the amazing thing with the
so we have the machines they cost 10 times more paper ballot would cost 8%
and they make paper ballots for watermarks and everything else severe sophist
if you take a look
paper ball
8%
and you're done by 9:00 in the evening
now we have the sophisticated machine that goes up to heaven and goes all over the place and down and
and they say we'll need two weeks to figure out who the hell won the election do you think that's by Design I think it's very crooked that's my opinion
you're allowed to have an opinion what could let's say you win
in November what can be done to mitigate these problems what could be done
you know at the level that the president has power
well if I win that'll be this will be my last election
but I think I know it's to the country yeah yeah but I think I owe it to the country we have to have Fair elections so how can you fix that you know Jimmy Carter was in charge of a commission you know that many years ago
and they put him in scoop Jackson in various Senators you know distinguish people that were retire
and they came up with the
and the reports primary funding
you cannot have mail-in ball
because if it's a mail-in ballot you know I went to the voting booth the last time whenever it was
and I walked in in Palm Beach and I walk
and they know
they say Mr President can I see your identification is this is that
and then you said and you they watch you sign
you really does not a lot you can do I mean if you wanted to be dishonest it's sort of beautiful if instead of that
I'm going to send them a ballad
it has to go through the Postal Services it has to go through a lot of people
they mail you a houses that you know the house was demolished and the people have left
it's so
the one thing with Jimmy Carter he had a very strong
Commission
no mail
and we're the only one that does elections this way anymore they've gotten away and this is a picked up in a big way after covid it used to be like soldiers serving overseas coverage to certainly push the smell and about another thing but they use covid to cheat in the last election was a little bit of
you couldn't even get security guys big strong guys to watch
you know what you'd call them they call him
they were afraid to go out you know we had we were in the middle of Co
we were in the middle of covid right smack in the
and they didn't want to die you know they don't want to catch it
it was like
in a way it was it was like a ghost
the whole thing but mail-in ballots are bad things that certainly is a problem male and ballots are probably another country is the most bizarre argument that I've never seen anybody articulate in a way that's convincing people why don't you well it doesn't make sense any other way I've tried to straw man or I try to steal it I've tried to like look at it from a position like why would you not want people to have ID
and a lot of the ideas are just ridiculous you need to get a driver's license
Gavin Newsom one of the worst governors in the world
and I used to Frank I used to get along but I don't get along
because he's just too you know it's just a whole con job but Gavin news
the other day sign
that you are not allowed to ask a person even ask them whether or not they have a voter ID so what could be a child reason why because they want you but that would be the only thing that makes sense that's taking it to the next level
you know you have ID the Democratic National Convention when they had it the last time I saw
they had a sign like a billboard on the the name of the person where they live how they live who the hell their boyfriends are every single
it was at a big picture
that's for
they have an idea of Big Ideas it was hanging like you were prison
they have these massive cards everything
And yet when it comes to the world in theory the most important thing we do okay when you go to a grocery store you give
but for a vote it's supposed to be a sacred thing and it should be a sacred
no voter ID because they want to
what doesn't make sense in any other way I've tried to look at it no other way there's no argument that anybody is presented that makes any sense why you know the funny thing Joe the Democrats the people
they all think you should have it in other words you should have yeah if you go to the people
the Mrs Schwartz Mrs Smith Mr and Mrs Jones sure they say of course
Democrats
did they
it's the politicians that don't want it like Schumer and these guys they don't
because they want to be able to cheat because you know
if they didn't have it okay
who is going to vote for somebody that wants open borders who's going to vote for somebody that wants to have
Men playing in women's sports
I have never had one person come up to me and say
president you got to do something to allow men to play in women's sports
have you ever just like I've never been called by upholstery I told you my little Theory and posters
I'm getting myself in trouble with some of these things but I don't really care
nobody's ever come up to me and said
we want to have
Men playing women
I had a
add a property Ione in California I have a woman is a very good a
and she works there as a manager
and Brian Urlacher the big Chicago Bears great player you know
10 time off so I guess all of them a great guy big strong
and then she said oh he's one of my favorite athletes can I have
and I took a picture and I said and I noticed she was the size of his leg his leg was bigger than she
and I put it
should men play in women's what the hell it was just so ridiculous
what's one of the most bizarre polarizing ideas that's promoted by the lake now unless you're going to cheat
in elections you never going to get nobody wants it but I don't think anybody wants
I've never I've been told everything you know you can some people want
I don't know of anybody that wants open borders nobody's ever come up to me and say president you got to let the world come into our country
so they have 21 million I think it's much harder than that because you've got a ways you know got away is where they just walk in they work
and the other thing you have is human traffickers you have traffic is in the traffic in women
and they're going wild now
we used to you know what you have to look the trunk of cars can you believe that they put women and Trunks they'll put three women in a trunk these people are savages they're horrible the worst people do you and they're
the kind of money they make on drugs they're almost making on trafficking
and the thing that's made it hot is the internet that's
you know but you think of it almost as an ancient thing
what is the
but who would want to have these things who would want to have there's so many the transgender operations
were there allowed to take your child
when he goes to school and turn him into a male to a female without
parental
who wants this does anybody want this I've never heard of anyone and I can go into 10 different things
the only way they get
is
no voter ID you can't have voter ID they don't want any they want
there's only one reason
the voter ID is so
it's the most basic thing that's very
who would
they want it so they can cheat because their policies are no
they're very smart when it comes to that
they're very smart although they're not smart in terms of politics in a way because
what do they have that people want they really don't have they give away a lot of Health Care a lot of stuff
but for the most part their policies are terrible their policy on Military she's running on a tax like she's going to raise your taxes you got to hear
we are going to raise your taxes and the people
but who is going to win
with all my life I grew up with politicians lower
she's she's politicking that we are going to raise your taxes will they want to raise the ideas you want to raise the taxes to the highest earners I know but but it doesn't really paying their fair share price right and it's a narrative that appeals to people that are not doing well and like yeah our problems are these rich people are not paying taxes are the rich people going to leave and they're going to close up the companies and then the other people aren't going to have jobs you know that's what happens when it does but the whole because you brought it up I'll tell you what we just
he's doing a very good job in Virginia Glenn yonkin I don't know if you like them or not like I don't know but you don't have the governor of Virginia
we have a case where they found thousands of
illegal ball
a judge just ruled that they have to be able to
just happened today just before I walked in here I
a judge just
you have to keep those people in they're illegal they're illegal vot
now I think they'll be overturned at the next court one thing I found cuz I had a couple of things that they get overturned a little bit you know the system because the system
you have to hope
that the Appellate judges
honest otherwise we don't have a country anymore
it's very important
put the whole thing with the legal balance it's got to be looked at you got to have you have to have voter ID and you have to have additional idea you have to have an ID that shows that your citizen of the country they don't want that either I agree one of the things that I want to talk to you about is the JFK file
and one of the things that you said was that if they showed you
what they showed me this is your quote you wouldn't want people to know it
I opened them
I was met with from good people look up being good
the people that
we're well meeting Mike Pompeo was
he's a good person
they called me they said Sherwood rather have
after and I did open
but I was asked by some people not
what does Martin Luther King file too by the way that they'd like to see I don't know if you know but there is that
but but JFK in part
they called me a lot of good people call me people that I you know that you would find reasonable people
and they asked me not to do it so I said well we'll close it for another time
if I win I'm going to open them up I'm just going to open it up the first time the address is people that are still living
there are people that are affect
and it could be some National Security reason that for you know that I don't have to necessarily know about
put some very good talented people ask me not to do
I opened it up and then they said
would it be possible for us to do that a different day how much of it did you read into
I think it's going to be just fine to open it let me put it that way I think it's fine it's going to be
it's a cleansing you know it's really a
so I'm going to do it I'm going to do it immediately almost immediately upon entering office well the thing when people look at it from the outside and you sort of imagine what could be a reason why they would not release those files
it would be there's people that were implicated assassination
when they're living people you generally tend not to want to do it when people are still living
living people that formerly work for the government for the government and living people that were somehow involved in it and you tend not to do that
how about it's time to open
I can't tell you whether or not they're going to find anything of interest and I did partially over I think I've opened up 50%
but I was asked not to do it and I
I thought that was a reasonable blast but now I'm going to do it I'm going to do it very
there's a lot of interest in it one of the things that a lot of interest in the people coming from space you know yes and I know you're interested in that how much did they tell you about that a lot
how much can you tell house that work cuz it's like super Tuesday
but I interview
a few people it's never been my thing I have to be honest I have never been a Believer I have people that
Area 51 or whatever it is I think it's the number one tourist attraction in the whole country or something Area 51 in Las Vegas do you know that right sure I know what it is so anyway but it's a big tours like so
I interviewed jet
if you saw them you'd love to have a message I had him in the who had that siding in 2004 very very compelling with visual visual video evidence radar EV
I don't believe his name but I interviewed jet pil
we're solid people
and they said we saw things
we're very strange like a round ball but it wasn't a comet or
it was something
it was going four times faster than an F-22 which is a very fast plant
and it was
which is an ethereal so when you were talking to these people was was this something that you were compelled to have conversations about was this your personal interest a little bit it's not a great interest for me but it's a little
I get that question as much as almost any question do you think that we have aliens coming you know flying around or whatever what do you
there's no reason not to I mean there's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life you know what Mars we've had probes there and Rovers and I don't think there's any life that we don't know maybe there was a time this is a speculation about Mars at Mars had an atmosphere at one point in time a long time ago that could support life it also had large bodies of water
but we've had no evidence of even bacterial life that exists on Mars but
they would have never done it with me where they put the balloon up and a lot of people that and a lot of people thought for a little while that that was one of these things so that's a lot of the speculation too that some of these drones that hover over battleships that these are Chinese drones and they're not UFOs they could be awesome
let's say three or four guys
and without tremendous interest
if you had
as I said you'd love to have me as your children
beautiful people
they said sir there's something there you know
in 2004 off the coast of San Diego they clock that thing going from 50,000 ft above sea level to 50 in a second I don't know what it is yeah they saw something in the water it was hovering over that something that was making a disturbance in the water
they got video evidence of this thing two different fighter jets with pilots in them
you know Visual Evidence photographic evidence video evidence radar evidence
whatever the hell it is it moves in a way that would turn a human being in a Jello if they're inside of it the g-force no one would survive what is that
signature they don't know what their propulsion system was
but when you fly in some of these
at these Pilots have to be in great shape oh yeah the Blue Angels won again when you when you fly in somebody's face but these things that these people are counting are far superior to what we know of is it possible that there's some military or government program that you were
that they didn't tell you about
I think I had a great relationship with the military basically but you know I didn't like certain people I would have gotten them out if I thought if I were
if the election was different I would have fired
all of them quickly something most of them I did
Biden should have fired every military person involved with Afghan
he should have had a lot of fairies you know if you look at him he told Israel not to do anything at least Israel is not going to look at a bomb the way they would have been
think if they listen to bid
they be waiting for a bomb to drop on their head right now
he's been wrong about so much I guess you'd have to say that she's been wrong too because you know they she always said they made the decision together
Israel didn't follow his advice and I think it was a very
you know there is a very the Middle East is rapidly changing you know
the prophets that say the world will come to an
in the Middle East you know that
we have weapons today that are so scary when you look
I rebuilt
and when you look at the weapons we have today the biggest threat we have in the world today is
nuclear weapons and we have other weapons to that are devastated
the nuclear weapons the biggest threat we have in the world today and that's
I was talking about de-escalation with both China and Russia I'm telling you
we were going to discuss that they were going to de-escalate you got to be careful when it's a little tricky playing with
cuz they said we're going to do it and they don't do it maybe
but they understood the curse too it's a curse it's China's way behind us but they'll catch us within 5 years so let's imagine let's let's say you win in November what do you do differently and how do you change this course that it seems we are on for World War III how do you get us out of Ukraine how do you stop what's going on in the Middle East how do you put a stop to this well it's it's a very
to me it's an easy question because I think I can do it easily but it's a complex question in the sense
the times change everyday changes
who's winning who's not winning
Russia's a war
whether you like it or not it Just grinds along grinds the longest speak to people like Victor or
just a big fat War Machine and that's what's happening you look at what's happened to ukr
if I were there it would have never happened but what could you do now if you get in the office again what can you do now right now
you would get both of them I know both very well
and then again I cannot I do not want to tell you you know for the purpose of looking smart to five people that you know that say oh he was great because
if I told you exactly what I do I could I could never make the deal
all I can tell you is that I would meet with Putin and I would meet with him and I know exactly what I'd say to each one of them and I believe
that as president-elect I would get that war stopped and stopped fast
you know we have tremendous power in the United States if you know how to use the power
I stopped other Wars just by the use of tariff
I got macron of France good guys like a friend of
what is a wise
and
person that likes France said he was going to tax our
I say and I said all the smartest guys I sent mnuchin they all failed
and I said I'll do it myself and I called him I said Eamon
your taxi American companies we're not going to allow you to do that O'Donnell I cannot do nothing I can do it's already been
I said Eamon
if you do that I'm going to put 100% tariff when your wines and Champagnes are coming to the United States
and you're going to regret that you
turn on please it's not
anyway within about 2 minutes he dropped the whole thing and it was massive amounts of money against American companies I have to protect
they don't know how to talk
they met in Alaska
the Chinese
in the Chinese lecture them
how badly we treat
okay let me
do you remember that that was like an event they didn't talk to me that way
they respected me they respect
our country they don't respect our country they don't respect bid
dinner respect her they're dreaming about her
because she's incompetent she's not a smart person look she can't put two sentences together she talks I watch her two
I watch the last night too it's the same thing
she's not a smart person
these guys are very smart and they're very StreetWise and they're very tricky and evil and dangerous
and if she becomes
the president of the United States which I can't believe can happen
I don't think this country is going to make it I don't think we'll ever be
I think I think it just really bad things will happen to our country
and you know what I look at the outside forces and I say they can all be
because we have a pot
but we're not going to have that pot of gold to play with anymore you know it's a great negotiating
I told you I knocked out this massive car company going to take all of our car business from Detroit
I knocked it out just by my rhetoric rhetorically I
they'll never sell a car in here I'll put tariffs I don't care the 2000% they're never going to build that plant today is it possible to apply that same thing to the electronics that we use one of the things that disturbs me greatly is that all of our phones are made overseas and then some of our phones are made in places
yes and the chips and some of our phones are made in places like Foxconn where they have Nets around the building to keep people from jumping off the roof cuz they have so many suicides like wouldn't it be better to have an American-made iPhone where you know people are paid good wages they have health insurance they're taking care of they can live a good life
well you're not buying a piece of electronics that's cheaper because someone has to suffer a horrible in a horrible way that's not even legal in the United States
it's not even legal to have them work that way in the United States so they get these people to build them overseas and you do it but let me just
that chip deal
we put a billions of dollars for Rich companies to come in and borrow the money and build chip companies here
and they're not going to give us the good companies anyway
all you had to do is charge him tariffs if you would have put a
on the chips coming in
you would have been able to just like the auto company is no
more sophisticated but
you know Taiwan
they stole our chip business
they want us to protect and they want protection they don't pay us money for the protection you know
the mob makes you pay money
with these countries that we
I got hundreds of billions of dollars
from NATO countries that were never paying
am I biggest fan of stoltenberg who just left
you know director
as a secretary
good
he said Bush came he made his speech Obama came he made a speech Trump came he said you guys aren't paying you got to
and I said will you protect us from Russia if we don't I said no you got to pay if you don't
billions of dollars
tomato
when I see us paying a lot of money to have people build that's not
you don't have to put up 10% you could have done it with a series of tariffs in other words you tariff it's so
that they will come and build that ship companies for nothing in other words
you put a big tariff on the chips coming
I said you don't have to pay the Tariff all you have to do is build your plant in the United States
we didn't have to give him the money to build a plant besides
they're very rich companies these chip companies they
they sell 95% of our business it's in Taiwan right now
they do a great job but that's only cuz we have stupid politicians we lost the chip
and now we think we're going to pay you can't build it that
you have to make them spend their money in the United States and those plants would open up all of and they'll find them we don't have to put up 10
and I am in the process of making a huge speech about a little
and you and how long have we been talking a long
you are something
I said how long will this last anywhere from
an hour to 3:04
3
