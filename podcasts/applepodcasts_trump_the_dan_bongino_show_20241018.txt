cuz the mega crowd is the most loyal people have never seen your crowd as me pretty much they're like super extra
and then Eddie's campaigning now in Pennsylvania
I got a couple questions for you I appreciate your time okay
the Secret Service obviously a sensitive topic with me I spent 12 years are protected Democrat and Republican president something really close to my heart I know you've told the story quite we all saw
I spoke to you the next day we had a conversation on the phone it was amazing like you told the story almost like you weren't even there you were
I couldn't believe how
you came within inches of
dying on television is no easy way to put it
can we commit today to some kind of commission or reform the Secret Service we can get some outside experts to make substantive reforms when you're in
show the people I've met from Secret Service and I know a lot of them right they're amazing they're really good they had a really bad day in Butler
and I don't know whose fault that was you know I guess she go top-level but
that building should have been covered obviously
but if you look at what happened when those bullets started going off they were on top of me really quickly and they were
it's a miracle they weren't hit actually I think the guy was
set a stun something happened to him something happened
the Secret Service shooter was amazing because he was very far away and
you spent one bull
what do you think
but everybody I've met from the secret service has been so good but they had a bad day there's no doubt about it we're not allowed in this world to have a bad day right now not on this one this is too big
I think they did a good job the second time some people said you should have called him the day before
or you should have never been there but that was a great job that the other Secret Service the second
Secret Service
to see a barrel coming out of a bush with something pretty amazing but
no it's got to be safe got to be
yeah we need to reform that it's it's really important
how is the report at the report came out yesterday and it confirms a lot of things that I've said being an agent for over a decade of my life
is the president they have this government attitude this kind of segue is nicely into another question I had you you're from the private sector okay I was giving an example I was chatting waiting for you to my audience to come down from your fox interview and what you were doing
one of the toughest places in the world to build you know that you're dealing with bureaucrats unions unions were conflicting interests how you got all this done I don't even know but you
you tell a guy a guy I need 15 floors of concrete in 6 months and he tells you hey we came up 10 floors
you're going with the new concrete company and by the way you're dealing with a lot of interest you know what I mean especially in New York you've been there right that doesn't happen in New York I mean in the government excuse me you were president of the United States you have these failed agencies that that blew it the Secret Service that did this whole you know yesterday's technology tomorrow we used to laugh with her that they didn't have a drone
so when you get in the office say with someone like an Elon
are you planning on some systemic wide review of the FBI secret Services other than entities
we're not doing it this way anymore we're going to produce results for the American people or you're all getting a boot we're out this is it we're
well then if you know you have to have the best people and it's all about the people and
I know nothing about you know very little about that although
I've learned a lot over the last few weeks it's amazing you know we had a
O'Reilly in Butler second rally we had 107,000 people that turned days and it's it's been it's become a great site I don't know if you like a memorial site where cars are riding up and down the road honking their horns from all over the place they're coming from all over the country it's become like what is it in Nevada where they have the site with the aliens right now I think it's the largest Butler
they ride up and down the side and they
it's beautiful actually
I know the Secret Service well I
I didn't know the top person but I know the people that work on my detail they're very you know very good you know a lot of them and they're great people
something went wrong and you can't let it go wrong so
I can't tell you you'd be somebody good to look into that you would be good that was your business man you would be good but they got to they got to get it right it's dangerous I'll tell you what being president is a dangerous profession when you think okay I mean forget about me
it's 1/10 of 1% die as a race car driver okay so you take 1% now you take 1/10 of that that's what
and these guys are going around the track at 220 mph
the bull riding to me looks like you know that's that's not something I want to do
and it's about the same 1/10 you know they get killed they get killed but when you think about it
a lot of presidents have been
and even assassinated relative to the relative to the number
so I always say this is a dangerous business I never thought of that when I ran you know you think everything's Gucci
but it's a nasty business one thing I would like to do
the first shoot
which I say was a miracle I mean you know it's lucky I moved to the
but if I didn't turn to the right for over immigration say I got saved
over a legal immigration to charge my all-time favorite
but but the first shoot
add three app
and two of them they say we're far in
and they haven't opened those apps and I wonder why the FBI hasn't done that the second shooter had
at 6:00 now who has six of them have you ever heard of anyone I
but who has six
and you would think that
and I guarantee they open it for January 6th all those guys got their sales open
so why are they opening so I do ask that question
why isn't the FBI opening up those
never know you know where these people are coming from they may look innocent like you know they're nice country boys but
they may not be so I'd like to see them open that up and fast and then we'll get down to the bottom of it I suspect there's probably some foreign connections here and I can't believe I just don't trust the FBI yeah it wasn't even their experience I understand that it's not like we're basing this off some
hypothetical they spied on your campaign we have the names of the spies I mean I wrote three books
and then they go after the people that went after the spies and Spider-Man
and if you look it was Biden and Obama
the Deep State they wanted that forgotten as quick as possible quickly as possible
the fake news media they hate to cover
we have it all
I don't think any at 60 minutes and you know she never gave me an apartment and David
when I said crime is rampant he said no crime has gone down
because they didn't include the word said the FBI correction they were 1699 moments you've had the one that infuriates me the most it's actually a segment on my show is the Leslie Stahl sir moment sir we can't verify you're the media you loser what do you mean you can't your job is all you had to do is go to the FBI and ask you know it look it's hey I think the worst
Scandal I've ever seen in broadcast history
will maybe not be as much of a scanner that were Republican would have been over when they changed comma has answered they didn't edit
they took her entire would show she was crazy they took it out the entire paragraph and it was a long lots of things they say word salad I don't like the term actually
how do you say a word so it was just words like rambling words horrible so they take it out and they put
another statement that you made two pages later
they in
and nobody would have known the difference and they got
cuz I like to speak in a long sentence is paragraph
and if they take a sentence out like in the middle it really does screw it
but but think of this they took the whole thing
and they replaced it
a totally unrelated
add time
and they put it
and that's the only one that we
that we want them to release the tapes
so I think I'm going to sue
if they do and even if they win it's going to be very embarrassing
is 60 minutes till I've done it many times I did it with Mike Wallace the best one I ever had was Mike Wallace and he was the biggest killer
you know Chris tries to be Mike but it just you still have to have it he's not but
it's a very embarrassing moment for them but the media is not pressing it you would think the media would be pressing
it's so bad they should lose their license and they should take 60 minutes off the
this is like the 64,000 question many years ago have you ever read the books on television
they cut somebody they gave somebody the answers
he was a very famous though they ended up giving him the answers
the whole thing that it was the biggest Scandal maybe in television but this is potentially
it's election interference
they gave her
it was worse than that they took the answer out and put a new answer in
Mr President I think you should call them 61 minutes from now on
because they had an extra minute for comma so I think it's a mistake to call him 60 Minutes you're giving him too much credit so in public speeches just referred him 61 they had an extra minute for comma David
everything I said
every single thing I said he
and he was wrong I think on every one of them I'm pretty sure
and he never questioned her and she talked about Charlottesville she took all things that have been as they say debunked another time I don't like but it's a pretty accurate
all totally debunked bloodbath they use the bloodbath that was talking about the car industry right now not talking about a blood pressure he use the word bloodbath these people are sick you got to say that they are good at what they do you have to admire it says they are sick you know you and I are New York kids you know I'm just a slight tad bit younger but you remember 1980s Times Square pretty Giuliani you remember the Folex is the fake Rolexes and then all the peep shows and stuff I mean some of the scammers were good guys you know I don't know that a country
people honest
Democrats don't have to be honest I really don't have to be honest because they're not going to they will never be accused of anything
it's interesting I was so amazed
Harvey Weinstein
schlonged he got hit as hard as you can get
because he was sort of the king of the world
and yet he got hit and I figured that baby
he wouldn't get hit so hard
but boy did he get you don't know him well I don't know him well but I watch
and it was amazing
so when they do get hit they get
but that's the only one I can think of normally they protect everybody
what they did with Adams I think is very suspect that would you bring that up last night with the immigration problem in New York City is the mayor here and all of a sudden I predicted it so he came out pretty strongly against the migrants taking over the city
as a Mary should and not getting
you know they
3 billion on migrants in the federal government is not there to pay
but he he won against the party
I said he will be indicted within 6 months I know these
like the range jacksmith is a deranged individual you see he's going to release another Manifesto I mean is this the this guy is at 4:44 and the judge is allowing them to do
it's not even believable this guy is a sick pupp
then they going to release something else and always before the election you know they want to do it before the election selection inter
no it's a terrible thing what's happening and the judges
discharge
evil person
I never say anything like it she was shotgun they all said
well make sure you don't get shot
because you don't have to get approved by lots of different people
but they said make sure you don't get shotgun well I have nothing to do with
so you know they supposedly
they pick balls right
I don't think it works that way but that's what they say that's the way it's supposed to be
you pick out of a
do that forget about the range Jack Smith you know judge is supposed to keep it what church
say we're going to release something you know
a couple of days before by the way would you have almost no ability to respond to he should be making
everyone in their system is innocent until proven guilty not guilty until proven innocent it's disgraceful it's amazing thing well you know what the real
he said it about
3 weeks ago when Jack Smith released the first you look it up I'm pretty sure it was honing but it was definitely on CN
and he was I think a federal prose
and
I've never seen anything like this where the prosecutor
gets to release an uncontested memo
with unproven char
not in a courtroom but basically a campaign document gives the most obscene again CNN which let's be honest I hate your
the legal analyst for CNN it's the top
has been against all of this he said Trump did nothing wrong I'm so amazed I'm more impressed with that than anything else I've seen on C
but you know cuz you'd think they'd try and stop
he is one of the
biggest Guardians of the Constitution I mean he really is he's a great lawyer he said this is really unfair but think of it right before the election now I don't even know what it says this is made up by other people has nothing to do with me
and you don't even get a right to answer
it is see that selection interference right there that's cheating on an election because I know I've been proven to be you tackled you like you gave him a triangle choke from the back of the car you're pretty talented guy a lot of people said don't dispute that makes you look very tough and strong and then the men of the right is supposed to be a great white
I just had to go for him and I got him around the neck and this was a woman who
I think the testimony is all now gone so what happened
to meet is one of the greatest scanned
the unselected committee of political hack
Cheney all these people Chinese you know they say we have a Republican
the Republicans say that they have kissing and crying is always cry
I've never seen him when he's not cry
they come crying at him kissing he cries every time you know he said desperate he sees a 6
those are the two Republicans okay so they say the bipartisan committee they were much worse than any Democrat the Democrats were nothing so anyway
the head of
Benny Thom
you're real
he decided to
destroy all evidence of the of this year and a half
everything is gone the reason is because
I was so
and like as an example this one
I won't mention names the girl the person that did that it said that
it's been totally
it's been unconfirmed the secret service agent said never
never happened okay first of all you wouldn't be able to do it anymore I said let's tell the truth
it never happened I actually said
I'd love to go down remember peacefully in patriotically do you know they don't mention that in any paper no
biggest most important part peacefully and Patriot
they don't mention that in any paper in any document in anything it's crazy so it was oldest Pro
they did you know that they've destroyed all evidence
now you're supposed to go to jail if you destroy EV
even in a civil case you go to jail
they destroyed they
and we have decided to destroy all evidence having to do with the unselect
I love the name unselect because it's called the selectivity like it's I call it the UN
can you find a weird that the January 6th unselect committee which I agree is unselect about
do you find a weird they're not interested about why Kamala Harris was not at the Capitol in January 6th but was at the DNC when my mom was outside they keep saying it's an Insurrection why doesn't she tell that stupid deal the whole thing is rigged 100% can you get an answer as well I do believe I do believe this is really the other thing is as you know
they really won in the Supreme Court okay the Fisher case and the various
why are they still being
nobody's ever been treated like this nobody's ever maybe the Japanese during Second World War Frank
how about you know they were held
but when you look at Portland and the Damage they did and killed people
because other than Ashley nobody was killed
nobody was
and there were no guns involved and these are all gun owners you know these are people that have guns but they never went to the Capitol
it's really amazing
it's a very sad I think it's a very sad day in the country's life but they but
end of this
they destroyed
and delete
all Eevee
so now we're not going to know what she said about how I beat the crap out of these two secret service station
I was so strong I am just ripped around those big next 24 inch necks I ripped my arm around them and they didn't have a chance can you imagine that but how do I delete it and destroy it you're not allowed to do this Secret Service deleted the text from that day too and they said it was a tech transfer it was not it's a lie so if you get elected I'm really hoping we can get to the bottom we should talk
can I ask you something else about a kind of a switching gear
you know what the media paint you into this ridiculous you've seen the caricatures they're
you know what I was going through cancer treatment at Sloan-Kettering I was going for surgery and I had a bad incident
you called me that day from the White House and I got to tell you I was really touched by the
you are extremely loyal to your
and I say to people you know why cuz he's a
and tell me if I'm right here's my theory Donald Trump theory on Queens why you got the bravado and the machismo white of guys really like you and the bro
Queen's guys we never had the money in the Manhattan kids so you don't have like the class like of the Manhattan you're not in like the Upper Crust of this fake caste system we have in New York you know it exists but we're never given the tough guy credit the Brooklyn and the Bronx kids are nobody wants to fight them just because they say they're from
somewhere from
it's a great place to learn a lot of very successful people came out of Queens is it's a place of successful people as
Priscilla
baby the Bronx do a little bit of
Beyond
it's really
I have seen over the years people married
and having a great relationship in the successful then it doesn't work out they go to somebody else and they lose everything
The Man Behind the woman and the woman behind the man is both his works out both
but I've seen many cases where somebody successful
what was somebody else not successful at all secret weapon
number one is number one on the list New York Times list not to be number one for Trump
to be number one on the New York Times list
not even believable
do you know what you have to go she had to be number one by thousands of books okay because that pretty tough on that know she's got the number one bestseller melan
can I ask you a question about your business time in New York
what woman
Roman rank is a ice skating rink the city couldn't fix it for whatever 500 years because it's the city of New York it was a train wreck they come to you
they say Mr Trump at the time where I'm running for president or anything you know can you fix this mess you got it done in record time I don't remember
what was it was closed for 11 years
my kids were getting older
think I'm saying Ivanka Daddy can I go ice skating
I'm sorry darling the rink is under construction
you have to saying that for 11 years you know for 11 years it's been under construction for 11 years
my darling you're the most beautiful little ice skater but there goes your career cuz you have to start young and they were building so they were building it for 11 years
that just you know numbers that were unbelievable they couldn't get it to work
they were building it wrong that the wrong pipe that the wrong system
they use the refrigeration company from Miami
are you going to go to Miami for Ricky go to Canada I went to the Montreal can
you have to use a brine system anyway if they were using a gas station they're the wrong everything
50,000 ft
in a little tiny patches so is all on it and you never said what's your job like
so I took it over so it was under construction for 11 years I got it done
two and
I had cement trucks going to
I had some trucks going from the
back to Har
you know along the park and I had 40/50 trucks standing there all
over two day period at one time
and then I tried to hook up pipes the whole thing was the craziest thing
and the people from the Montreal Canadiens came down and he said oh and you remember they kept stealing the copper pipe you know you put pipe in the concrete but every night they put the pipe in the pipe would be gone the next day the thieves cuz copper is very expensive
you want to use ho
and I still have water in it warm water
and you have to put salt in the water that way it does it that's the whole
that was a big factor you know it's called Brian
it's water and
so the salt doesn't let it freeze
and it was great and we opened it and I ran it for many years
and de Blasio cam
and by the way I hit him hard last night did you see that were you watching last night so they had the Alfred Smith Al Smith dinner last night the big Catholic dinner in the plaza
it was great the Cardinals everybody was every skip
everybody was there but
I love you a joke about tampon Tim by the way that he didn't show up but he's telling everyone he's there a lot of jokes it's actually you're supposed to be a comedian at least for part of your speech say yes it was a great evening de Blasio the worst Maron history
you know
I think Jenkins was really bad I think Dinkins was I mean they called him stick
Jenkins was bad I mean are you and I been through college Dinkins be
mayors of New York I worked as a cop under Giuliani I mean you wanted to Times Square under Giuliani that's actually one of my questions you have bad enough yet New York City
you know you and I lived through the Giuliani
you go up you get off the train station in Times Square you get hit with 7 hooker 20 drug dealers and three card Monte guys left and right right
Giuliani gets elected Mr President you know as well as you walk through Times Square 6808 it's a totally different place so when people tell me Donald Trump who grew up in that New York and is committed to changing government can't fix things it's it's it's it's it's it's it's too bad I say BS it was a 1000 times worse in New York and Giuliani turned it around like that well it's getting bad I will say it's getting bad bad things are happening and the migrants are making it happen really bad because you know we
100,000 migrants nobody has any idea how many
and interesting the mayor said you know this is not sustainable and I said he'll be indicted and he was indicted they indict
same group that we just talked
and it's let's see what happens I mean let's see what happens with it
having a young Rudy at this moment in a young lady because he did he did a great job you saw it this city was a mess this whole place was
and within a couple of years it became the safest big city in the world right that was amazing and it was great for you he's got to be given credit for it he did a great job the question for my audience I got I put out a call I said give me some questions for president Trump want to hear what you all have to say
person
your first term you were new to politics which was a benefit but in a little way has a little bit has a downside and that you don't know all the players your business guy so people recommended you hires you had to get rid of a lot of people a lot of them turned out to be turkey
and they're concerned the second term that we may have that same problem I've told them I know your team I know they get it now
do you have I'm not asking for any names I don't want you I wouldn't I wouldn't dare but do you have a set of people now you know you can trust him we get in because we're not going to have a lot of time in two years there could be a midterm issue we've got two years to clean This Disaster up you feel like you've got a roster like I first got elected then I was only you probably heard me say the story but I was there 17c so I wasn't watching the person I know really nobody there
then mostly cuz I was building a hotel in Pennsylvania
Avenue and a beautiful hotel
that I sold to the Waldorf Astoria you know I did it but I did a beautiful job but it was mostly for that so I was I was essentially never in Washington so I didn't know people so I didn't rely on people you know for big positions I'm saying hey do you know anybody that can be like this job and that job and generally I got it very good we had lighthizer trade we had we had a lot of good guys
but we also made some mistakes made mistakes
attorney general made mistakes I made some
and I don't really blame myself for you know they were highly recommended by rhin
and they weren't the right people they just weren't the right people
and there were some other positions to mostly I got a right you know nobody ever talks about the good we had a lot of great people but we had some some mist
and when I fire them
immediately the book companies go to them and they say I will give you a book of you say bad things about
if bushfires somebody nobody cares you know if somebody else fine but immediately
when I fire they go to and they write something or they say
Lake Bolton was a staff he was a dumb guy very stupid guy but actually he came in handy cuz he was a maniac and he always wanted to go to war with me today what's up he wants to buy it so I just went he wouldn't talk because
you stupid but what happened I bring him into a room with Putin
Trump wants to go to war because Bolton was with bush and you know think of
they went into the Middle East they bombed the hell out of the place and they left you know
he would go he wanted to bomb anything
he's a
but he was good for negotiating purposes but then after a while you see your fire
and whenever you fire people
generally if if they have an option with me they have most people don't care it's like they get fired but there's nobody to write about the boss but if the boss is famous
thinking maybe get a book
so I believe in firing people for instance in Afghanistan
Biden should a fire every General and every person involved in that botched job moving the soldiers out first everything they disgrace they should have all been how do you leave the military base first in
nuclear weapons
anyway that's where it is
that's the saddest story in maybe the most embarrassing story in the history of our country that whole Afghanistan
we were getting out but we were going to get out with dignity and strength and we were going to get out it was going to be great we had to get out it was 220 years 21 years it was ridiculous
you're the president say that 2020 debacle doesn't happen and you're sitting there in the oval I agree we had to get out of there do you say to them the Taliban here's the deal Brothers we are leaving but I'm telling you right now
you touch a hair on the head of one of our people
we are going to rain but I didn't say that we didn't have any Soldier shot after I spoke with Abdullah the leader of the Taliban
we didn't have any Soldier not one soldier for 18 months was killed and Biden actually admitted that a speech a few years ago
