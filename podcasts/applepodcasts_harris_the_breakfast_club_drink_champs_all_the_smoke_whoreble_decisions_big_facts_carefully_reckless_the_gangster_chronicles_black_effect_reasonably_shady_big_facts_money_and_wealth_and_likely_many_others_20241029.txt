you know I am well we are 8 days out at 7:00 a week out practically and I am just I'm in I'm in the zone right we got to cover a lot of ground there's still a lot of people to talk with
and so I am traveling all over the country in particular the the swing states to talk with folks and organize them and remind folks of the power of their
will you know Madam vice president you know I support you this is Charlamagne you know I support you
The Breakfast Club support you in 2018 when you came up here I told you I thought you would be president one day and I think God is setting us up for a woman of color president in 2020 I think that is Senator Kamala Harris I think she's our future president and I hope she I hope God puts his hands on her and says you know what I want you to do this all right we thought it would be in 2020 I was on the campaign trail with you in 2020 so I'm happy to see you in this position and the reason I'm stressing that I'm voting for you on November 5th is because Trump is has been running these ads with myself and these ads without our permission how do we come back that can we
well yes I mean look truth is always going to Prevail over the misinformation and the lies but it takes work right and so having this conversation right now so all your listeners know but there is a lot of misinformation and disinformation because they don't actually want to talk about the truth because their truth is a failing truth and so yeah we got to keep reminding folks of the reality which is I am blessed and honored to have your support and the support of so many communities and individuals who are their names are known and some names you know you're listening to me not know but they are leaders in their Community vice president if you were here I would be holding up my Hampton University of Charlotte how do you answer that for people that don't know what what is the real news when it comes to that
well first of all to your point he has spent tens of millions of dollars trying to hit me with a bunch of disinformation and misinformation on this and he's living in a glass house because the policies he's speaking about in terms of those surgeries were also his policies
and the reality of it is that it would also those as relate to two people
versus the fact that he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act which would impact 45 million people he wants to get rid of art $35 a month cap on insulin which would impact millions of people including millions of our seniors black and brown folks Latinos are 70% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes black Americans 60% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes he wants to get rid of all of that he wants to take away Healthcare through Medicare and he wants to distract
from the fact that he actually not only does he have a plan on this versus no plan on anything else
but his plan is to get rid of HealthCare coverage for the most need
will you know why he was at MSG yesterday while he had to rally at MSG and he had people up there insulting Puerto Ricans and black people and Jewish people you was actually in Philly reaching out to the Black and Latino
yes and you know it just turned out that Charlamagne to be real coincidence but again pointing out a stark contrast between Hannah and I yes I was in Philly meeting with leaders many leaders in many communities but including leaders in the Puerto Rican Community to talk with them about my long-standing commitment
2 Puerto Rico to the people
who live on that island who have often been overlooked in fact they know and we talked about the fact that even when I was in the United States Senate knowing Puerto Rico doesn't have its own United States Senator I was a leader in making sure that we would get relief to people on the island when it came to like the aftermath of hurricane Maria
and what I shared with everyone is part of my opportunity economy as you know which is about lifting up people around home ownership and small businesses that I will have a specific opportunity economy tasks
4 Puerto Rico
that will focus on the needs that they have in terms of fixing that electrical Grid in Puerto Rico and also bringing private sector investment together with government investment and non-profit investment onto the island to help with job creation and sustainability for the island

this is Lauren nice to meet you we are we talk a lot up here about the black man conversation the fact that people you know they keep trying to push this whole black man and not supporting my hair and my question to you is you know the fact that you know even if it's a lie people are still saying it what is your strong push to any black man right now that feels like you're not speaking directly
to them and about the things that they should care about for their families and for
Woodlawn I have to tell you back to what Charlene is shouting in the background
the brothers aren't saying
I mean I was just
at the barber shop in in Philly talking with very incredible and distinguished men who are leaders in their community in small business and education and these men these black men were talking about not only their support for me but most importantly their support from my perspective on what we can do that lifts up the community and Taps into the Ambitions and the aspirations for example the work that I will do that includes not only increasing access to capital for small businesses in minority on small businesses but part of my agenda includes a 20,000 forgivable loan
for startup small businesses who are invariably going to be the folks that you and I are now talking about who just need that startup help to be able to buy the equipment or to start up a meaningful website you know it cuz it can't just be starting up a business and having your cousin set up your website right it's got to be something where it can actually help you access markets and customers
these are the kinds of things we talked about and I will tell you at the Rally's that I am doing where there are thousands of people I just did a rally the other night 30,000 people were there and the number of people who cover the whole span of race gender and age but the black men in particular who are at the rallies have recently been saying to me don't you listen to that and they got to stop with all that noise we support you so I'm glad you raise the topic so we could actually deal with the reality of it versus what some of the media is trying to create Us in there you know Paul came out yesterday that said I was ABC News 855 points for black men from 2020
yeah I mean listen because I think unless I have said from the very beginning black men are no different than any other voter you have to earn their
and and part of the the challenge I think with the perspective in this narrative has been to suggest anybody's got black men in their pocket know you have to earn the vote which is why I've been out talking with folks about not only my history of work that has had a positive impact
but also the work that has yet to be done again around lifting up the economic situation helping Young Fathers with what they want to do to parent their children with an extension of the child tax credit to $6,000 for the first year of their child's life what I intend to do that is about tapping into the the desire for homeownership and a 2500 down payment assistance for first-time home buyers and that's why those numbers are 855
I have a genuine commitment
based on hard work that I have already done to lift up the community versus to your point Donald Trump and Madison Square Garden last night with all those tropes versus Donald Trump who took out a full-page ad in the New York Times for the Central Park five suggesting that these young black and brown and they were not young men they were children should be executed Donald Trump who in New York as a landlord refuse to rent
the black families Donald Trump who called the first black president is called him out and suggested he was not born in the United States and then most recently refers to Black legal immigrants in Ohio and so they're eating their
absolutely I was going to ask you know we see the support you have with small businesses we see the support you have with hbcus we even see the home buying voucher that is is there to help
especially our community get into our homes
what is your message that he's undecided voters that are right now where a week away that still don't know which way they want to go and and everything that you trying to do that's positive they say well the home buying voucher is just going to make people a charge more money for houses in an HBCU uses for this and for that what do you say to those undecided voters right now that we're a week
first of all please go and you know I'm going to throw out my website djm because people have to be able to see it and read it for themselves and take their time with it for those who are interested and want to be more informed and if I haven't had a chance to meet with them and talk with them directly I invite you in your busy lives if you can take some time
to look at my website Kamala Harris cam
and look at my
for example 25,000 down payment assistance for first-time home buyers let me tell you why that's not going to
that's not going to have an unintended effect because that increases the demand for home ownership which is going to have an impact also on Supply what we are not part of my plan is you know I've been in public service my entire career but I know the limitations of government so part of my plan for affordable housing is to work with home builders and developers to give them tax credits to create incentives for them to build more home but I'm going to tell you another part of my perspective on this I also know that in particular for high rent a lot of it has to do with corporate corporations that are buying up all this housing
and part of my plan is to also go after them
similarly on the price of groceries you and I both know it's still too high I'm going to go after price gouging which is those bad corporations that are jacking up the price of everyday Necessities for folks especially those who are for example in the zone of hurricane Helene and other places that have experienced extreme emergencies and those bad corporations and most of them are not but those that will take advantage of the desperation of people in need
these are the examples and I will tell you look I'm about to give a speech Tuesday night at the ellipse in front of the white
and part of what I will be talking about is
there is going to be a new president on January 20th of next year and it's either going to be Donald Trump or it's going to be me
and I would ask people to imagine the Oval Office people have seen it on TV
you know what it looks like it's either going to be Donald Trump sitting behind that desk
writing out his enemies
of who he's going to seek revenge and retribution on or it's going to be me working on behalf of the American people as I always have done working on my to do
to see through these policies that are about home ownership lifting up our small businesses lifting up families with children and lifting up the discourse in a way that it is not about thrashing people all the time which is why you know even back to the point of Puerto Rico
Bad Bunny is endorsement right he knows and and and and and and and and Jennifer Lopez and they love Puerto Rico and they are proud in terms of that Heritage and they know how demeaning and destructive
Donald Trump
can be on things like that I'm proud to have the support of the kinds of people not like those that Donald Trump's rally yesterday and Madison Square Garden the people supporting me Bad Bunny bad joke quavo Beyonce Kelly Rowland and I could go on down the
so I'd invite people to just look at who is supporting who as one measure of who cares about who the holidays are just around the corner and if you anything like me that means you'll be hosting all your family and friends

where to investors Don't Take Your Eye Off the FED Jim Clark Republic Monetary Exchange inflation is ticking back up Court consumer prices have now is in 53 months in a row but the FED has a lower rates again remember our warning they're in a debt trap it's inflate or die we aren't you to take advantage of any temporary pullback and gold and silver prices think of it as a gift one that won't last we're Republic Monetary Exchange in Phoenix on Camelback just east of 40th Street 602 682 gold or rme gold.com how do you feel about these major Publications like the LA Times The Washington Post refusing to endorse somebody for president
you know Charlamagne it's disappointing no doubt but the other piece of it is
it gets back to my point about who is Donald Trump because he is the one right who is
up for election with me and
you know he he
I think that some of your listeners they know and others may not which is that look
it's billionaires in Donald Trump's Club that's who's in his Club
that's who he hangs out with that's who he cares about
that's why when he was last president he put in a place a massive tax cut for billionaires in the biggest corporations and that is exactly what he will do again his policies are not about middle-class folks he's not sitting around thinking about what he can do to take care of your grandmother and your grandfather
he's thinking about people like himself or himself and all of his Grievances and all that makes him angry about how he has personally been treated as opposed to worrying about how you have been treated and what his responsibility is to lift you up
will Madam Vice President we appreciate you know you got to check it in I know you got calls to make and things to do today I do have one last quick question though how often do you say to yourself
man fuck
you know let me tell you actually the my focus and honestly more is on I just love I love the American people
and I you know
that people are taking time out of their so busy lives with all their demands to take the time to vote
the stand in line
especially in those places where their state leaders have tried to make it more difficult for them to vote
that's that's really where I spend my time in in the contrast point is really about that they deserve better
they deserve better they deserve a president who actually
okay talk to you soon thank you
